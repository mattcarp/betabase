# Product Requirements Document: AOMA Unified Vector Store Architecture

## Project Overview
Transform the AOMA orchestration system from a distributed multi-endpoint architecture to a unified vector store approach, reducing response times from 25+ seconds to sub-second performance while maintaining comprehensive multi-source intelligence.

## Business Goals
- Achieve 95%+ reduction in query response latency (25s → <1s)
- Maintain or improve response accuracy through intelligent multi-source synthesis
- Scale to handle 10x query volume without performance degradation
- Provide real-time access to AOMA knowledge across all data sources

## User Personas
1. **AOMA Engineers**: Need fast access to technical documentation, system status, and integration details
2. **Support Teams**: Require quick resolution of user issues using comprehensive knowledge base
3. **Product Managers**: Want insights from Jira, Git commits, and system metrics for planning
4. **System Administrators**: Need real-time system health and performance data

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Unified Vector Store**
   - Single Supabase database with pgvector extension
   - Consolidated embeddings from all AOMA data sources
   - Real-time data synchronization and freshness tracking

2. **Multi-Source Data Ingestion**
   - AOMA Knowledge Base vectorization
   - Jira ticket content embedding
   - Git commit history processing
   - Email/communication context extraction
   - System metrics and telemetry data

3. **Intelligent Orchestration**
   - Smart source selection based on query analysis
   - Vector similarity search with source filtering
   - Progressive response enhancement
   - Fallback to current system if needed

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response caching with intelligent invalidation
   - Query optimization and monitoring
   - Progressive loading for complex queries
   - Performance analytics dashboard

### Technical Specifications
- **Database**: Supabase with pgvector (1536-dimensional embeddings)
- **Embedding Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **Query Processing**: <1 second target for 95% of queries
- **Data Freshness**: Real-time sync with 5-minute maximum staleness
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent queries

## User Experience Flow

### Current Experience
1. User asks AOMA question
2. System orchestrates multiple API calls (25+ seconds)
3. User receives consolidated response (if successful)

### Target Experience  
1. User asks AOMA question
2. Intelligent orchestrator queries unified vector store (<1 second)
3. System returns synthesized multi-source response immediately
4. Optional: Progressive enhancement for complex queries

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: 95% of queries respond in <1 second
- **Accuracy**: Response quality scores maintain >90% satisfaction
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Adoption**: 100% migration from current distributed system

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Set up Supabase vector store infrastructure
- Create data ingestion framework
- Implement AOMA knowledge base vectorization

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Integration (2 weeks)
- Add Jira ticket ingestion pipeline
- Implement Git commit vectorization
- Build email context extraction

### Phase 3: Smart Orchestration (2 weeks)
- Update orchestrator for vector store queries
- Implement intelligent source selection algorithms
- Add progressive response streaming

### Phase 4: Optimization & Launch (2 weeks)
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- A/B testing against current system
- Full production deployment

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality**: Automated embedding validation and quality checks
- **Performance**: Load testing and capacity planning
- **Reliability**: Graceful fallback to distributed system
- **Security**: Proper access controls and data encryption

## Dependencies
- Supabase instance with pgvector extension
- OpenAI API access for embeddings
- Current AOMA system data sources
- TaskMaster AI for project management

## Definition of Done
- Sub-second response times achieved for 95% of queries
- All data sources successfully integrated into vector store
- Performance monitoring dashboard operational
- Current system deprecated with successful migration
- Documentation and knowledge transfer completed

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Vector Store Foundation
- As an engineer, I want a unified data store so that queries don't timeout
- As a system admin, I want real-time sync monitoring so I know data is fresh
- As a developer, I want proper indexing so that queries are fast

### Epic 2: Multi-Source Intelligence  
- As a support agent, I want consolidated information so I can resolve issues quickly
- As a product manager, I want insights from all sources so I can make informed decisions
- As an AOMA user, I want comprehensive answers so I don't need to check multiple systems

### Epic 3: Performance Optimization
- As any user, I want instant responses so I can maintain my workflow
- As a system admin, I want performance monitoring so I can optimize the system
- As a developer, I want intelligent caching so the system scales efficiently

This unified approach will revolutionize AOMA system performance while maintaining the comprehensive intelligence that makes our responses valuable.

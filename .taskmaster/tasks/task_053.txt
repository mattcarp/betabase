# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Tab Navigation UI for ChatPage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: high
# Description: CRITICAL P0 BLOCKER: Add a tab navigation bar to ChatPage to enable switching between Chat, HUD, Test, Fix, and Curate modes. Without this navigation UI, users cannot access Test, Fix, and Curate modes, blocking essential functionality.
# Details:
URGENT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED - This is a P0 blocker that must be completed TODAY. Users currently cannot access Test, Fix, and Curate modes without the tab navigation UI.

To implement the tab navigation UI on the ChatPage, first review the existing componentModes defined in ChatPage.tsx. Design a responsive tab navigation bar using React and Shadcn components to match the existing UI style. Each tab should correspond to one of the modes: Chat, HUD, Test, Fix, and Curate. Ensure the navigation bar is accessible and supports keyboard navigation. Implement state management to track the active tab and update the displayed content accordingly. Consider using React Router for managing mode-specific routes if applicable. Test the UI across different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and usability. Additionally, ensure that the navigation bar integrates seamlessly with the existing Electron app environment.

This implementation is critical for unblocking user access to essential application features and must be prioritized above all other non-P0 tasks.

# Test Strategy:
PRIORITY TESTING - Must be completed TODAY:
1. Verify that the tab navigation bar is visible and correctly styled on the ChatPage.
2. Test switching between tabs to ensure the correct mode content is displayed, particularly Test, Fix, and Curate modes.
3. Check keyboard accessibility by navigating through tabs using the keyboard.
4. Validate responsiveness by testing the UI on various screen sizes and resolutions.
5. Ensure that the navigation bar functions correctly within the Electron app, without causing any performance issues or errors.
6. Verify that all previously inaccessible modes (Test, Fix, Curate) are now fully accessible through the navigation.

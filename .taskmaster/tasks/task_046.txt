# Task ID: 46
# Title: Complete Migration from Tauri to Electron
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 36, 41
# Priority: high
# Description: Finalize the complete migration from Tauri to Electron + React + TypeScript + Vite architecture.
# Details:
Complete the architectural migration that's already in progress. Remove any remaining Tauri-specific configurations and dependencies. Ensure all existing functionality (ElevenLabs integration, JARVIS interface, audio capture) works seamlessly in the Electron environment. Update all documentation to reflect the Electron-based architecture. Verify that the React + TypeScript + Vite frontend is properly integrated with Electron's main and renderer processes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify complete migration by ensuring no Tauri dependencies remain and all core functionality works in Electron. Test that ElevenLabs integration, JARVIS interface, and audio capture all function correctly in the new architecture.

# Task ID: 43
# Title: Finalize Electron Deployment Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the deployment infrastructure for the Electron-based SIAM application.
# Details:
Finalize the migration from Tauri to Electron by completing deployment and packaging configurations. Set up Electron-specific build processes, auto-updater functionality, and cross-platform distribution. Update CI/CD pipeline to handle Electron app packaging and signing. Create installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux that properly bundle the React + TypeScript + Vite frontend with Electron.

# Test Strategy:
Test Electron app packaging and installation across all target platforms, verifying auto-update functionality and proper app signing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Electron-Specific Build Processes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish and configure the build system tailored for Electron, including defining entry points, packaging scripts, and environment-specific settings.
### Details:
This involves creating or updating configuration files (such as main.js and package.json), setting up Electron Builder or similar tools, and ensuring the build process generates platform-specific binaries.

## 2. Configure Auto-Updater Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Integrate and configure an auto-update mechanism compatible with Electron to ensure seamless delivery of updates to end users.
### Details:
Select and set up an auto-updater library (such as electron-updater), configure update servers, and implement update checks and notifications within the Electron app.

## 3. Update CI/CD Pipeline for Electron [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1, 43.2
### Description: Modify the existing CI/CD pipeline to support Electron-specific build, test, and deployment workflows.
### Details:
Update pipeline scripts to handle Electron builds, automate artifact creation, integrate code signing, and trigger auto-update publishing as needed.

## 4. Create Cross-Platform Installation Packages [done]
### Dependencies: 43.3
### Description: Generate installation packages for all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) using Electron's packaging tools.
### Details:
Configure Electron Builder or similar tools to produce installers (e.g., .exe, .dmg, .AppImage) and ensure all dependencies are bundled correctly for each platform.

## 5. Test Deployment on All Target Platforms [done]
### Dependencies: 43.4
### Description: Thoroughly test the installation, update, and runtime behavior of the Electron app on all supported operating systems.
### Details:
Perform manual and automated tests to verify installation, auto-update, and core functionality across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

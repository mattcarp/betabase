# Task ID: 54
# Title: Implement Functional Interfaces for Test, Fix, and Curate Modes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: high
# Description: CRITICAL P0 BLOCKER: Develop fully functional interfaces for Test, Fix, and Curate modes on the ChatPage, replacing placeholder console logs with interactive tools and management systems. This is a high-priority blocker that must be completed TODAY as Fiona needs working knowledge curation tools immediately.
# Details:
URGENT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED - This is a P0 blocker that must be completed TODAY. Currently the Test, Fix, and Curate modes only show console.log messages, making them completely useless even with tab navigation. Fiona needs working knowledge curation tools TODAY.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Replace ALL console.log placeholders with functional interfaces
- Prioritize Curate Mode as Fiona needs knowledge curation tools immediately
- Must be completed TODAY to unblock P0 functionality

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Curate Mode (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: Develop a fully functional knowledge base curation and management system. Implement features for adding, editing, and organizing knowledge base entries. Use a rich text editor for content creation and ensure seamless integration with the existing database. This is the most critical component as Fiona needs these tools TODAY.

2. **Test Mode**: Develop audio testing and calibration tools. Use Web Audio API for real-time audio processing and testing. Implement features such as microphone input testing, speaker output calibration, and ambient noise analysis. Ensure the interface is intuitive and provides clear feedback to users.

3. **Fix Mode**: Create a system diagnostics and troubleshooting interface. Integrate with existing system APIs to fetch diagnostic data such as CPU usage, memory status, and network connectivity. Provide users with actionable insights and troubleshooting steps based on the diagnostics.

Ensure all interfaces are responsive and accessible, adhering to current UI/UX best practices. Use React and Shadcn components to maintain consistency with the existing application design.

# Test Strategy:
**PRIORITY TESTING - Must be completed TODAY:**

1. **Curate Mode (CRITICAL)**: Validate the knowledge base management features by adding, editing, and organizing entries. Ensure data integrity and correct database interactions. Test rich text editor functionality and database persistence.

2. **Test Mode**: Verify audio testing tools function correctly by simulating various audio scenarios and checking calibration accuracy. Ensure user feedback is clear and actionable.

3. **Fix Mode**: Test system diagnostics by simulating different system states and verifying that the interface provides accurate diagnostics and troubleshooting steps.

Conduct rapid usability testing to ensure all interfaces are intuitive and meet user needs. Perform accessibility checks to ensure compliance with WCAG standards. Focus testing on Curate Mode as this is the highest priority for immediate user needs.

# Title: Integrate Playwright Test Runners with Test Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 56, 60
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect real Playwright test runners to the Test Dashboard to display live test results and execution status.
# Details:
To integrate Playwright test runners with the Test Dashboard, begin by setting up a communication channel between the test runners and the dashboard. This can be achieved by using a WebSocket or REST API to send test execution data from the Playwright tests to the dashboard. Implement a middleware or service that listens for test events from Playwright, formats the data appropriately, and updates the dashboard in real-time. Ensure that the dashboard can handle concurrent test executions and display results accurately. Consider implementing features such as filtering, sorting, and searching test results on the dashboard. Additionally, ensure that the integration supports various test environments and configurations used in the project.

# Test Strategy:
1. Set up a test environment with Playwright tests running and verify that test execution data is sent to the Test Dashboard.
2. Check that the dashboard displays live updates of test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and error messages.
3. Test the dashboard's ability to handle multiple concurrent test executions and ensure data integrity.
4. Verify that the dashboard supports filtering, sorting, and searching of test results.
5. Conduct tests across different environments and configurations to ensure compatibility and robustness.

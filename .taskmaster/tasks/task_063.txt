# Title: Set up WebSocket server for real-time test execution updates in Test Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 61
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a WebSocket server to provide real-time updates on test execution status in the Test Dashboard.
# Details:
To set up the WebSocket server, first choose a suitable WebSocket library for the server-side implementation, such as 'ws' for Node.js. Implement the server to listen for connections from the Test Dashboard. Define a protocol for sending test execution updates, including test start, progress, and completion events. Ensure the server can handle multiple concurrent connections and broadcasts updates to all connected clients. Integrate the WebSocket server with the existing test execution framework to emit updates in real-time. Consider security aspects, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure only authorized clients can connect to the WebSocket server.

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy the WebSocket server in a test environment and establish a connection from the Test Dashboard.
2. Simulate test executions and verify that the dashboard receives real-time updates for each test event.
3. Test the server's ability to handle multiple concurrent connections and broadcast updates to all clients.
4. Verify that unauthorized clients cannot connect to the WebSocket server.
5. Check for any latency or performance issues during high load scenarios.

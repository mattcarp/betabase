## The Signature Aesthetic

**Minimal line art infographic, editorial layout, simple human pictogram figures with circular heads, dotted flow paths connecting stages, pastel accent colors, clean sans serif labels, process diagram, storytelling workflow, magazine editorial style.**

Be bold with color choices and visual interest. Flat, modern, interesting explainers that pop. Complete creative freedom - NO design system constraints!

## What This Means Technically:

### Visual Elements:
- **Line art**: Clean, minimal strokes - not heavy or bold
- **Pictogram figures**: Simple humans with circular heads (think: restroom sign style but warmer)
- **Flow paths**: Dotted lines connecting stages/steps
- **Colors**: Pastel accent colors (soft purple, soft blue, soft teal, soft yellow)
- **Typography**: Clean sans serif labels - modern, readable

### Layout:
- **Editorial magazine style**: Think Wired, FastCompany layouts
- **Storytelling workflow**: Clear narrative flow, left-to-right or top-to-bottom
- **Process diagram focus**: Show steps, stages, progression
- **Clean composition**: Lots of white space, not cluttered

### Tone:
- **Professional**: Suitable for business presentations
- **Approachable**: Not corporate stiff
- **Modern**: Contemporary design trends
- **Storytelling**: Guides the viewer through a narrative

# 🍌 Nano Banana Pro - Visual Style Guide

**✅ MATTIE'S APPROVED STYLE** (Updated Dec 18, 2025)

---

## The Signature Aesthetic

**Minimal line art infographic, editorial layout, simple human pictogram figures with circular heads, dotted flow paths connecting stages, pastel accent colors, clean sans serif labels, process diagram, storytelling workflow, magazine editorial style.**

Loosely reference MAC Design System principles for polish, but editorial storytelling takes priority.

---

## What This Means Technically:

### Visual Elements:
- **Line art**: Clean, minimal strokes - not heavy or bold
- **Pictogram figures**: Simple humans with circular heads (think: restroom sign style but warmer)
- **Flow paths**: Dotted lines connecting stages/steps
- **Colors**: Pastel accent colors (soft purple, soft blue, soft teal, soft yellow)
- **Typography**: Clean sans serif labels - modern, readable

### Layout:
- **Editorial magazine style**: Think Wired, FastCompany layouts
- **Storytelling workflow**: Clear narrative flow, left-to-right or top-to-bottom
- **Process diagram focus**: Show steps, stages, progression
- **Clean composition**: Lots of white space, not cluttered

### Tone:
- **Professional**: Suitable for business presentations
- **Approachable**: Not corporate stiff
- **Modern**: Contemporary design trends
- **Storytelling**: Guides the viewer through a narrative

---

## MAC Design System Reference (Loose):

Reference MAC principles for:
- Spacing/padding consistency
- Typography hierarchy
- Accessibility (contrast, readability)

But **editorial storytelling > strict MAC compliance**. If the story demands it, break the rules!

## Summary
- ✅ COMPLETED THE "FLASH COUP": Migrated entire codebase from Gemini 3 Pro to Gemini 3 Flash Preview (Released Dec 17, 2025).
- ✅ Benchmarked real AOMA RAG queries: Flash is ~40-60% faster and 4x cheaper.
- ✅ Updated modelConfig.ts, chat API route, and UI selectors.
- ✅ Cleaned up all diagnostic and testing scripts.
- ✅ Decision made to defer Context Caching as Flash performance is already optimal.

## Next Steps
- Monitor Langfuse for any edge-case quality issues with Flash (unlikely based on benchmarks).
- Proceed with feature work in features.json.

## Warnings/Blockers
- None. Gemini 3 Flash is a goddamn beast. ⚡

# ai-labs-claude-skills

A collection of reusable "skills" for Claude AI and developer tooling. Each skill is a small, focused package (under `packages/skills/`) that provides scripts, templates, and utilities for common developer tasks such as document processing, SEO analysis, CI/CD generation, Docker containerization, test analysis, and more.

## Key benefits
- Modular: Skills are organized per-folder so you can pick only what you need.
- Ready-to-run scripts: Includes CLI scripts for common workflows (SEO analysis, sitemap generation, document unpacking/validation, resume generation, etc.).
- Automations: Helpers to auto-generate package/index files and install skills into user projects.
- Reproducible builds: `build` copies packaged skills into `dist` for distribution.
- Extensible: Add new skills by creating a folder under `packages/skills/` and following the existing patterns.

Legacy export for 360 was designed only around productized exports (exports linked from a product via a product details) and not around master exports. However we no longer support A2 links to export page from product details so need to make sure master exports work as expected. We should fix all these issues for 360 so that converted export work.

There is a periodic issue that pops up for wav 16 downconverts where the conversion fails due to a sox issue. On the conversion is suggesting that the file has issues when this pops up but we have been unable to simulate this re-using the file. The working theory is that the there is an issue with the temp file on the AOMA side which is causing the issue. This ticket is to investigate the issue further (first step adding logs so we have a little more information)

 

*Notes:*

Seems to trigger more often when doing downconvert wav 24 from direct upload.

Confirmed this is an issue with directUpload workflows, the files are not in the temp location (direct migration) at the time of the conversion call. Simple upload seems to be working fine.

If a user does not have all the permissions tied to conversiontype list we will hide some of the conversions and store an array value on the UI selector (1,2,3 ETC. instead of CT #). On the backend though we do use the full list of CT's which can cause can cause the wrong CT to be used. We should either have CT values be passed to the backend or make sure both lists are always in sync.

In the simpleUploadMasterSelection page if wav 24 is the first option present for an upload it will display the mfit selector for all options instead of just the mfit option. This looks to be because of the way the mfit display logic behaves for wav24. We should hide the option if the master is non mfit (see below screenshot)

SimpleUploadMasterSelectAction.java line - 300ish. Add else block to wav24 code too

I'm not sure, that it's a bug. Looks like it's a FEATURE of an old batch offering search.
I didn't start investigating the code yet, but as I know, to search for WAV16, WAV24, and DDP, you need to put a ""flag"" in the search.
That flag will work for all the rest ISRCs in the list.
So, if we took the:

""
SEBGA1900579
SEBGA1900578
""
, and put it where ever at the top, before SEBGA2202050, then we will have a list like this:

SEBGA2300255
SEBGA2300257
SEBGA2300259
SEBGA2202700
SEBGA1900579
SEBGA1900578
SEBGA2202050
SEBGA2201891
SEBGA2200791
SEBGA2100410
SEBGA2100321
SEBGA2100169
SEBGA2001552
SEBGA2001499
SEBGA2001556
SEBGA2000189
SEBGE1900006
SEBGE1900005
SEBGE1900001

Starting from ""SEBGA2202050"" all of them have WAV16, so let's add that ""WAV16""

SEBGA2300255
SEBGA2300257
SEBGA2300259
SEBGA2202700
SEBGA1900579

As you can see in ""Add items from the collection"" there are no ""ISRCs"", which means for all ISRCs we found something.

 * 000005510350 - Audio Master WAV 24 Bit - 44.1kHz - MFiT

The problem - User attempts converted export, MP3 for standard master>>Export uses WAV instead. It looks like in the config shown above, the standard master at the bottom of the export UI is using the non-selected CT from the MFiT master at the top of the UI

Steps to reproduce:

1) Test product is G010002917054S>>5510370 - Audio Master WAV 24 Bit - 44.1kHz

2) Set up converted export of single track>>MP3 320:

Could you take a look at the MQA CT that Sharada created? This should be available in AOMA MFC Stage

 

Thanks,

Ralph;;;","20/Jan/22 8:29 PM;jdunca1;Hey Ralph. Working with it. Ran a test this morning, but haven't gotten the JSON file to show up in AOMA files yet.

Both are exporting JSON files to offerings via MFC Batch use as expected. I will note that the export of these files did take about 10 minutes when testing with 24 bit files, so this could be something to discuss as the process may add time to registration, but I will continue to test to see if that is a constent issue. 
I've also used this to have files checked by Trefor at MQA. 
So far, working as expected. Test Vector files to go in next.;;;","01/Feb/22 2:39 PM;sdonipu;CTID 2102 is in production now, went live as part of 2.16.0 build - 01/31/2022.

Hi [~jdunca1] , 

Looks like it might be an AOMA side issue during your testing then, but just so you know, a partial contribution to the delay can also be the MC system because at DEV Arvato and Stage Arvato MC environments which usually process MFC Conversions, have only one Windows WIP each to process any bulk MQA conversions as of today which could also result in slow processing. Please test the CT in production MFC and let us know if you experience the same delay. 

Thanks,
Sharada

Please share ETA on adding support for Spatial Audio CTs - 2605, 2606, and 2607 in DEV and STAGE. We have a production build on Monday 18th Oct for these CTs and we would like to do some basic AOMA <---> CONV testing before that. ;;;","18/Oct/21 5:38 PM;sdonipu;[~jpitzer] - Sorry for missing your question earlier. So the QUAD wavs come with a specific file naming which is in the spatial audio EPIC story. [~FERN009] and [~SAMA030] should be able to give you some examples that they tested this feature with.  Please let me know if you are still stuck with the testing.;;;","18/Oct/21 7:15 PM;jpitzer;Sharada,

I think the main problem here is that there was never any directive given that made reference to file naming in this case. And there was never a ticket that had the correct file naming as an AC.

I believe I now know what the correct file naming should be.

Regards,
Jack;;;","21/Oct/21 8:29 PM;fern009;Notes for this ticket:

1) No UI Validations from AOMA for the file naming specifications (Future enhancement)
 2) [~jpitzer] Please can you confirm if this functionality is working as expected with the accurate file naming specifications:
 - *TRK#__TRKTITLE__( ).wav*

03_HappyFeelin_FL.wav

03_HappyFeelin_RL.wav

03_HappyFeelin_FR.wav

03_HappyFeelin_RR.wav

3) There is no validation on the order of wav assets

4) If the file naming specifications are not met - MC will fail the job.

p.s. Jack, Brajesh apologies for not catching this requirement before the implementation. ;;;","21/Oct/21 9:40 PM;jpitzer;Verified in STAGE via ACS-2142 testing;;;",,,

Batch Export button on Mobile Audio Manager should be permission-driven,AOMA2-1780,1962655,,Development Task,Done,AOMA2,AOMA2,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,19/Aug/25 10:52 PM,27/Aug/25 7:34 PM,12/Oct/25 4:14 PM,20/Aug/25 6:58 PM,,AOMA-2.113.0,,,0,,"'+*Description*+

In the Mobile Audio Manager, there is a Batch Export button on the page. When a user clicks this button, it redirects them to the Batch Offering page. This button should be permission controlled.

The required permission is named *TEMP_LEGACY_BATCH_OFFERING*
• If a user has the *TEMP_LEGACY_BATCH_OFFERING* permission, they should be able to see the Batch Export button and click it to navigate to the Batch Offering page.
• If a user does not have this permission, the Batch Export button should not be visible.

+*User Story*+
*As a* user,
*I want* the Batch Export button in Mobile Audio Manager to be permission controlled by the *TEMP_LEGACY_BATCH_OFFERING* permission,
*so that* only authorized users can view and access the Batch Offering page through this button.

+*Acceptance Criteria*+

1. Visibility based on permission
*Given* a user has the *TEMP_LEGACY_BATCH_OFFERING* permission
*When* they access the Mobile Audio Manager page
*Then* the Batch Export button is visible to them.

2. Navigation when permission granted
*Given* a user has the *TEMP_LEGACY_BATCH_OFFERING* permission
*When* they click the Batch Export button
*Then* the system redirects them to the Batch Offering page.

3. No visibility without permission

CMG Revoke On Export Needs to Filter By Side Sequence,AOMA2-1214,1279242,,User Story,To Do,AOMA2,AOMA2,software,hale002,,,Normal,,,spag001,spag001,05/Jul/22 8:45 PM,20/Aug/25 4:56 PM,12/Oct/25 4:14 PM,,,,,,0,,"*Desc:*

When a user has a virtually side (or track?) linked ddp and blue-ray disc and attempt to export both assets to CES:
 * We create two export jobs
 * Each export has its own ces key stored export_keys db table

The issue that was noted was that the first export was not showing up in the system. This seems to be due to the fact the export key for the first export is getting revoked due to second ones filtering out for old jobs. When we check for active keys we filter by masterId and productId and both exports share this because they are both virtually linked to the same master.
{code:java}
CMGPackager.java

select k.original_export_delivery_status_id from export_keys k where k.product_id = ? and k.master_id = ? and k.export_key_status_id = ?{code}
To fix the issue we should also filter by the side sequence to make sure extra keys are not being deleted for this case.

*Dev Notes:*
 * The class to change is CMGPackager.java in the AOMA project
 ** In the doPackaging method we cancel out the old keys on line 448.
 ** We need to update this to include sequence in the db query look up for which keys should be revokved

*AC:*

When a user has a virtually side linked ddp and dvdddp and attempt to export both assets to CES:
 * We create two export jobs
 * Each export has its own ces key stored export_keys db table
 * Both export keys should remain active 

If a user exports one of those assets again
 * Only the assets tied to that sequence should be deleted.
 * (Also try virtual masters with multiple sides - example product from the dpsa was virtually side linked 2 ddps + 1 blu-ray disc.)

GRPS is transitioning to AMEBA-RDX GraphQL for AOMA - GRPS Publish readiness info and will discontinue using legacy WebService. GraphQL returns the same info in JSON format with identical rules.
 
This is available in production for testing, but it has not been used yet. Could you please test this GQL for Publish cases and share the results? We already compared XML to JSON in the stage environment, and everything works as expected.

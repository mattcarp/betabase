Perhaps I missed conversations on this whilst I've been away for paternity leave but my understanding is that the master storage asset for a shortform video registration has to be Pro Res 422 (HQ) even if a higher data rate file such as a Pro Res 4444 is submitted for registration.

I have reviewed aspera upload and found that aspera upload got stuck during asset transfer status and it cannot be recovered from backend.

Hence, I have marked both the asset uploads as failed, so that from UI you were able to delete it and try re uploading it via aspera. 

Do let me know if still you face any issue.

Have reviewed the logs further and found that the file were not copied properly, only 57% file got uploaded and though aspera transfer is showing completed. We are suspecting this is due to any of the file from source is got deleted in between transfer which may cause this issue.

Also, we found that some system variables which needs to be created does not happened due to above mentioned issue and this registration seems to be incomplete and stuck.

Hence we have to request the user to initiate new registration. We can mark this stuck in progress registration to ""FAILED"" status from backend, please let us know.

As a side note, if the registration package is of big size its better to break it into a small packages into different registrations so that it doesn't get stuck.

Please see the corrected description. Thanks for your help here!

Keith;;;","08/Oct/25 10:33 PM;poth003;Hi [~kmccar1],

We have added UST SFV ENVELOPE permission to 637 active and inactive users with UNIFIED SUBMISSION TOOL permission that did not have UST SFV ENVELOPE permission before. Also, currently, the roles 'ADMINISTRATOR' and 'GMP_MEDIA_ENGINEER' have the permission 'UNIFIED SUBMISSION TOOL' added to them. The role 'BASIC_USER' has UST SFV ENVELOPE permission added to it. Please confirm if we should be adding UST SFV ENVELOPE permission to 'ADMINISTRATOR' and 'GMP_MEDIA_ENGINEER' roles.

Thanks,

Phani;;;","08/Oct/25 11:01 PM;kmccar1;Oh I see, that's why our friend Niels was able to send an envelope in the first place. If it's been applied to the basic user role, and every account created is automatically set with said role, we can take no further action here. 

This note appears on the e-card (can I call it that): 
|Please note that the upload invite is only for one time use.| |

I'm going to guess that Niels may have accessed the link previously, causing the ”AccessDeniedAccess Denied” messages. Let me see if I can recreate in stage...

Thank for all the info, Phani.

user states: All these archives can be deleted because I believe they are redundant, and already exist in the elsewhere in the archive.  All the uploads that are ""being imported from source"" are usually because there was an issue that I had to fix or something to change and  I have no way to cancel Ci imports at all once they initiate, so I rename and reupload, then hope these wrong ones fail eventually so I can remove them.

I will need to review this one a bit more. The data looks fine for this master but the error seems to be on a look up query in the backend which is a bit odd.

Matthew;;;","07/Oct/25 9:26 PM;jdunca1;Hey all. Seems to be isolated to track 12.;;;","07/Oct/25 9:37 PM;spag001;Hi db team,

It looks like an extra all_assets entry is causing the issue here for track 12. From what I can tell there was a system issue when this was originally registered and the all_assets creation didn't roll back correctly for the failed registration.

Can you manually delete all_assets entry tied to asset_id = 74955814? I verified it does not have a corresponding asset_upload entry (though I believe its tied to the failed upload 785591).

Thanks

Are virtual side masters linked to digital products not available for A3 export? We have a digital box set here, linked to four separate DDP masters. I'm able to send them separately to Promo, but not together like we need it. The masters are all QC Locked and QC Approved, so I'm not quite sure what's blocking. 

!image-2025-10-07-14-03-05-266.png!

The only oddity I'm seeing is the older master linked as disc 1, 4562945 (registered in 2009) doesn't have the QC note lock timestamp like the others do.

Noting 48 failed SFV exports to the Promo system going back to August 1. What does this error actually mean? How can it be resolved? Why does a resubmit sometimes work and sometimes not? 

This is starting to cause major business noise - way too many failures. 

Please advise.

Thanks,

Keith;;;","18/Sep/25 6:31 PM;giri004;Hi [~kmccar1] 

There have been some intermittent issues with the S3 upload from Promo that is causing the failures specifically for the larger assets.

I have put in a fix for this and it currently in testing phase. Once the testing is completed, we will push this change along with the AOMA build.

Hi Toey,
 
Are you using the Aspera uploader for the 24 Bit WAV master upload? If so, please try TusD instead and let us know how it goes.

Hi Team,
 
I’m about to upload the audio masters to UST for both 16-bit and 24-bit formats. The 16-bit file uploads successfully, but I’m currently facing an issue with the 24-bit upload.
 
I’ve tried using both Chrome and Microsoft Edge, but unfortunately, it still doesn’t work on my end. Could you please advise?

I have analyzed UST logs. Please find the finding below 

User entered WPTS-447365 in text box.
Product number is missing in ticket https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/WPTS-447365
Whenever user enters ticket no, UST  system expects a product number tied to it for further processing.
Since it was missing in this case, there was exception in backend which prohibited  system from creating ticket.

;;;","28/Jul/25 3:16 PM;mcatande;When a user enters a Jira ticket number, in this example: WPTS-447365 

The expected behavior is as follows: 
 * If WPTS-447365 is in an open state (not complete or canceled status), the ticket is updated with a comment and a link to UST noting asset has been uploaded. 
 * If WPTS-447365 is in a closed state (is canceled or complete), a new ticket is created linked to WPTS-447365 labeled as a revision. 

Product Number in the Product Number field is irrelevant in this instance.  

What's the product number validation logic?  I'm curious why we'd need to validate against the product number and why a mismatched product number value would constitute a failed ticket creation.  A product number mismatch should result in a warning message in a Jira comment vs. failing to create or update an existing ticket as entered.  ;;;","01/Aug/25 6:19 PM;mcatande;In this instance the user entered in a WPTS# for a bulk ticket type.

Keith;;;","25/Jul/25 4:01 PM;kori002;Hi 

Checking this out.;;;","25/Jul/25 10:23 PM;woom001;note, this was an HD revision of the original SD submission via WPTS-443500.

it looks like there was a UST swap, but the original metadata for the SD was not updated for the HD file, (existing crops of 22,22,0,0 with Standard 4:3 PAR should have been updated at the time of the swap with 0,0,100,100 crops and square pixel PAR)

I've gone in and manually updated the crop data.

this probably failed UST submission in pre-flight because the HD file was not to spec; the size is 1080x720. the original SD was scaled up by 1.5x but the PAR was not accounted for; the video should have been compensated for square pixels to 960x720 instead.

ideal video (cropped) should look like this:

 !actual.jpg|thumbnail! 

the video currently (matted to 1280x720) looks like this (stretched):

 !current.jpg|thumbnail! 

this might have been creative and we should confirm, though this request seemed urgent at the time.

Hi everyone,

 

I hope you re all well.

Since yesterday I get this message after trying to upload a .wav (PCM) via TusD.

The audio seems fine and I can upload it via Aspera.

Have you heard of this problem?

 

 

Thanks!

I noticed when product linking (G010005463368D), the master duration (master ID: 26458234) was not populating, causing a duration mismatch. It’s happened to a couple other products as well, so wanted to flag.

Since the release is imminent, I have manually requested the registration of the 2 MVs via Ci and JIRA ticket.
However, I wish to prevent this issue from happening again in the future, so I would appreciate your guidance on how to resolve it.
 
 
 
Thanks,

I've uploaded the video to your migration folder under the folder named DPSA-30689. The original issue with the asset was due to frame rate.

I unfortunately can not get the assets for G010005484764O as it looks like the root of the issue was that the transfer of these files had issues. I'll need a little more time to investigate the full case of what happened here but I think for this one will need to reach out the user.

I've send [~READ008] a direct download link so we should be all good here. I've also found out the cause for this one and will create a fix ticket for the issue.

There is a bug that is allowing user's to attempt auto-correct in manual qc if they click the error categories. The problem being is that the asset in manual qc because the previous auto-correct conv failed so the asset never copied over. This kinda buries the original asset in these bad auto correct attempts which we dont have an asset for as the original auto-correct failed.

Thanks

Sure, I've copied the video masters into your workbench folder (migration/DPSA-30612/MVD_*).

However, it appears that none of the 11 VSCs exist on the filesystem. They aren't in backups either. I looked into the event history for a few of them and can't figure out what happened. I'm also not sure why they were included in the spreadsheet listing m5 issues; will add an indicator so these cases can be investigated separately. For VSCs, how much of a problem is it to unregister and generate new ones?

SME Poland has the wrong publish status for this one if we're trying to unregister. It's currently ""Pending Retirement,"" which will still keep the assets 'locked' on the AOMA side. 
 
Created DPSA-30913 to have the error message fixed...
 
NOTE: You cannot delete existing associations because this product has publish status requiring the assets to remain protected. You can perform a ""Hot Swap"" or request the product to be un-published for an ""Asset Related Reason"".

[~ohme01] noted an issue with registering the 24bit/44.1k/22 track WAV master (and subsequent down convert to 16bit) for product G010005497683C. 

The following attempts were via TusD / Full Master Side.

The first job stalled in the ""Asset Upload in Progress"" phase.

I unlinked the master and asked Jan to upload again (he thought it was possibly special characters in the file-names). The 24bit and 16bit WAV registration jobs appeared to have completed successfully.

Per the File-Name column though, four tracks were missing (14, 16, 17, 19). The rest of the tracks were simply moved up to incorrect slots, resulting in an 18 track master.

I removed those masters and tried from my side. The TusD upload was very slow (moving at a kb's pace). The upload completed after some time and submitted - this attempt remained with the ""Asset Upload In Progress"" status for hours.

Finally, I removed that master and uploaded the same assets, but this time via Aspera. The upload completed within minutes, and the 24 bit and 16bit downconvert jobs completed without issue (all 22 tracks intact).

...there are some troubles with asset sorting. As for now we have no clue what brings it to a chaos and will swap each track individually to sort it out. But in general, this is an issue where we should find the problem to avoid it in future uploads.

Any hints to what causes this problem are much welcome

An upload of 24/48 files + 16 bit conversion requested.

After a while I went to the “Registration Job Status” page to see if it already registered, which it apparently did .

 

!g4UAAAAASUVORK5CYII=|width=602,height=75,id=x_Imagen_x0020_5!

 

The product was then successfully scheduled (release on april 30{^}th{^}) and +full published+ in GRPS, *with no error alert.*

This album has three tracks that were singles previously published

Today a leak was detected on Instagram .

One of the already released singles, ""NO ME IMPORTA” (Track 3 in album), played “TU NOVIA II”(Track 5) one of the unreleased tracks.

After checking what happened, I noticed that despite the “Registration Successful” message, only the first six tracks appeared as registered, the remaining nine tracks didn’t.

But these tracks, except T1, were also messed up: T1 was OK, T2 contained audio from T4, {+}T3 from T5{+}, T4 from T7, T5 from T8 and  T6 from T10.

So the registration process assigned to the first six tracks the six ones that were correctly registered (T1,T4,T5,T7 & T8)

In the rush of our work I didn’t see this, I just acknowledged the successful registration.

But here’s another thing, Track 3 “NO ME IMPORTA” correctly shows duration 2:33 despite containing audio from “TU NOVIA II” that lasts 2:24.

The leak was produced when the scheduling for the album triggered the “new” audio of NO ME IMPORTA to Instagram.

After the leak was discovered, we took quite a while to figure out how it happened.

Fortunately the other two already published singles weren’t involved being track 7 and 11, out of the first six group.

Now apart that I should have seen the grayed-out tracks,I consider that the registration status should have stated “failed” and GRPS which is usually very strict with inconsistencies, should have denied the full publishing.;;;","07/Apr/25 6:15 PM;kmccar1;

Hi Rohit,

 

Right now I had an issue that maybe is related or not with the previous one.

 

I registered the 24/44 master of product G0100055021392 with the 16/44 creation option checked. (jobs# 2644939/46)

 

The 24/44 master registered correctly, but the generated 16/44 master, even though it says {*}registration successful{*}, is missing *track 02* (jobs# 2644939/46)

_So, to explain what you see in the recording is me, uploading a master of  47 tracks, via TusD for this product G010005512615C_

 

_I see the upload, and the asset sorting. Which is new actually._

_Past few days, I only see the upload and then nothing – no process update._

_This time I also see a failed message. I’ve attached it in this message. It only uploaded 40 items, while the master map contains 47 tracks._

 

_This recording is not how I;ve experienced the past uploads past days. If I upload via TusD, I upload and than nothing. No update, No AOMA Asset Status email… So this more info then I’ve got before._

 

_Next step, when I try to upload a new master, I receive an error that there’s already a masterupload in process and that I need to wait until this is finished. Perhaps this is normal, but I need to unlink the job ID, before I can upload again._

 

_When I proceed with Aspera. I receive a successful registration within minutes after uploading._

 

_Let me try to recreate my experience with tusD I had the last few days with other uploads, where I get no information regarding the upload I just did._

Sophie's issues seem to be very similar to what I just described in linked ticket DPSA-30851 last night.
 * higher track count (over 20)
- stalling during "" Uploading Asset to AMP S3"" / Asset Upload In Progress registration phase
- job does not time out (e.g., when the user-side upload doesn't complete after 6 hours, the job will fail)
 * - job does not progress on the UST interface
 * - Aspera-upload completes registration quickly without issue

There are some fixes going in tomorrow per Mohammed earlier today. Hoping these will start to alleviate some of these issues.

Two things on this one, team:
 # AOMA log out during uploads - I've personally rarely been forced logged out throughout the course of the day, and not during UST uploads. I know we sometimes have the rare system restart, but what else would force log out a user during an upload. Is there a time limit?
 # 15GB file - I've noticed that it can take the ui / TusD longer to respond when the video file is bigger. Is it possible that the restart upload button had been activated, but there was a delay in response?

Hi,

The China affiliates have been receiving this error (screenshot attached) when trying to register an audio or cover art asset using TusD to UST.

After selecting the files to upload, nothing happens, no files are uploaded or registered. When they refresh the page (they even waited a day) and attempt the upload again, they receive this error message.

This issue has happened multiple times recently and doesn’t seem to happen when they use Aspera Connect, just TusD.

They are currently using Microsoft Edge as a browser 

Do you have any idea what could be causing this issue?

Here's a few product numbers that had the issue but have since been fixed.

So error comes full side only allows one in progress upload at a time to prevent multiple submissions.

This looks to be because the partially registered master completed via UST shows in the system as a ""Full Master"" association, and Aoma 2 product linking will not allow a Full Master association to a product that does not contain the full track count. The only option is then to asset swap via UST which overwrites the original master, which as discussed last week is not a desirable method of swapping a master with a revised version.

Example is product G010005235364W which has 10 of 11 tracks registered @ 24 48kHz. I was unable to use Aoma 2 product linking to hotswap the 48kHz masters on this product.

Using master modify to view the master ID (24906491) for the 48kHz association shows only a 10 track master. The hotswap attempt via Aoma 2 product linking was like for like 10 track master to 10 track master (11 track product).

For the time being I have used UST to asset swap the tracks on that 48kHz master to be able to complete the job for Vietnam as close to their work hours as possible.",,hale002,kmccar1,lemo022,roraj01,saha007,spag001,venu001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,"<font color=""red"">AOMA Support</font><br><b>Hours:</b> Monday-Friday, 3:30 am-8:00 pm EST <br><b>Emergency After-Hours Support:</b> Send an email to <a href=""mailto:aoma.support@sonymusic.com"">aoma.support@sonymusic.com</a> with the JIRA ticket number and a brief description.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i21evb:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lemo022,,No,,,,,,,"06/Feb/24 6:20 PM;spag001;Hi all,

G010004713228Q
G0100047132221

Mobile audio assets appear to have been auto-linked *without *security group affliation. Parent product virtual master appears to be associated with South Africa security group, but possibly updated after the mobile product metadata imports and subsequent auto-links. 

As a result. the [~TOBI017] and the GMP team are unable to select these products via the Mobile Audio Manager (not-selectable.png). There doesn't appear to be any sort of notification pointing to the cause. After updating the virtual master linked to G0100047132301 and G010004713224Y with South Africa, both were available for selection via the Mobile Audio Manager (screenshot-1). 

The best solution may be to not allow virtual master links to go thru without security group affliation in the first place. That way, any subsequent linking to mobile products will have the proper security group affliation and editable.

They noticed that both the HD and the MFiT were peaking at the reduced volume MFiT levels. (-.5 vs -.2).

I re-exported the non-MFit to confirm that I hadn't made a mistake, and sure enough it sends the -.5 master. Using export, I was able to get the correct master that peaks at -.2.;;;","06/Dec/22 8:25 PM;kmccar1;Thanks for confirming, [~jdunca1].

Hey, did we ever have a Converted option for 360 RA? I don't see it currently, at least when I select Local as a destination.

Yes, there certainly used to be a Converted Track option in AOMA 2 Export to Local. I should note that this ticket was originally titled ""...AOMA 2"" and to my knowledge there never was a converted track export option in AOMA 3 for 360RA products.

Created/linked fix ticket on the A2 side for this since the new export is still a bit off. Also as a workaround for the future, manually providing the product version of the A2 export url should work (a dev can generate this in the future if this pops up again.) We have shared the url for this one with the user.

As discussed, the import failed because of the participant's name size is more than current field size in the DB.

There are some characters like character ú is a *lowercase 'u' with an acute accent and* á, é  etc ... which occupies more space.

Here is the participant_number:{*}1658239{*}

If business want to keep these characters with acute accent, then we have to do impact analysis and may have to fix the column size in multiple places in the app and DB.

Please advise

The issue is due to a bug on the Batch Offering UI where if the users are dont have all the CT permissions there is a mismatch between lists. Due to this what was happening before is the CT that was actually being used was CT 12188 which is a 60 clip conversion instead of 1 which is the copy.

As a temp workaround I've added the missing permission (CONVERT_AUDIO_TIER_2) to the three GMP users so it should be going as expected now. I've also linked the fix ticket here.

As discussed on the 8/18 Graphics call we need to figure out what is the value on column Q on the spreadsheet.;;;","19/Aug/25 8:53 PM;spag001;Hi [~mcatande],

The value for video_average_data_rate that is returned by conversion should be bits/sec. That value for legacy registrations is directly being stored in the database column. In UST however we are converting it to kbps (diving by 1000). Not sure the reason behind this I assume it was part of an old AC. 

So long story short if the asset was registered legacy its bits/sec, if its UST then its kbps.

Thanks

That's something that can be added to the report, otherwise there isn't a easy way to determine that based off the current report. [~poth003] can we add if it was a UST registration or not to the report?

Also one additional update I would like to make, legacy might also be in kbps (though a little unclear). So the legacy registered SFV is going through CT to 2063 to create the descriptor file. In that logic we are using a field called {color:#000000}*Video Average Data Rate* {color}to set this value. In UST workflows we are using CT 4101 for the descriptor generation. For this workflow we are using *SME_Video_Bitrate* for this value. I am noticing the values are a little off though from each other so this might be worth a discussion on the video sync up call. (I assume the newer CT is just more accurate)

Thanks

The AOMA part took around 60 minutes, and now it's processing in MI.

;;;","12/Sep/24 10:17 PM;coconne;While we are waiting on this...can i please ask to understand this process a little better?    Should we expect this same issue any time this product has a change?   

For example, when the label Full Publishes the product? (It's currently open published) would that update require this same effort?

What about if data on one track on the product changes?  Would we expect this same process?

 

I'm just thinking for a product this large, we could expect metadata changes over time.

 

Also, this product coming through and being so large, this shouldn't delay information coming from GRPS to EOM on other products (right?)  Like this product isn't taking up all lanes on the highway....right?;;;","12/Sep/24 10:44 PM;vleung1;Yes, in the example of changing the publish status, this would be considered a high priority import and will go through the same process.
If data on a track has changed and the product has more than 300 tracks, as is in this case, GRAS Export will only process them over the weekend when there is less traffic.

This shouldn't delay other products coming in from GRPS to EOM, unless they are updating the same data. For example, the same participant.  In that case, this will cause a concurrency exception (this can happen at either AOMA or EOM side) and will be redirected to a different queue to reprocess again, one product at a time to avoid the same concurrency exception.  So this will not take up all lanes on the highway.;;;","13/Sep/24 2:04 AM;coconne;Good to know, Thanks Vivien!;;;","13/Sep/24 9:22 AM;zeki001;The import process for this product has been completed successfully.

As discussed with Craig and [~nanj001], we will look into the long processing time for these large products and try to make improvements.;;;","13/Sep/24 7:42 PM;cmiller;If there's partner title overrides on any of the tracks, then scheduling additional partners could indeed require the product to be ingested into MI again as Vivien indicates. But if NO such partner title overrides exist, then a scheduling change should NOT require an update via the Metadata Import process because scheduling data travels via a different interface.

Kiran.;;;","19/Aug/25 8:50 PM;kuma011;Hi [~mcatande],

Confirmation & Root Cause:

Keith's assessment is correct — the issue occurred because the product G010003602297I did not have a security group assigned. Without a security group, the user lacked the necessary permissions to export the track associated with this product, which caused the export to fail.

Error Details:
{
""message"": ""User does not have required permission to perform the action."",
""catalogKey"": ""G010003602297I"",
""status"": ""FAILED"",
""reason"": ""Export cannot handle product G010003602297I request""
}

This error information is currently not visible in the UI, as it is only stored in the backend. However, we are working on the Batch Details page for the September build, which will display all relevant batch-related data — including export errors — directly in the UI to improve visibility and debugging.

Resolution:
The missing security group has already been updated by Keith. The product G010003602297I should now be good to export.

Very weird.  I've attached a zip of all the AOMA notifications I received from today.  There are two asset sorting failures which would cancel the job as a registration failure. I also see multiple asset sorting success notifications and two registration success notifications.  Oddly enough the registration success notifications appear to be under Roberto's user name? 

+[@Colasuono, Roberto, Sony Music Italy|mailto:roberto.colasuono@sonymusic.com]+ - As a note there are additional steps in the registration process now when using Full Master or Full Master Side upload.  There is an additional step called ""Asset Sorting"" which is an added step after upload for AOMA to sort the files so that they land in the correct track/sequence when registered.  Asset sorting has its own notification, and once this is successful the registration process begins and you should receive a second notification for successful registration. 

 

+[@Sony Music-US, AOMA Support|mailto:aoma.support@sonymusic.com]+ - Can you look at these notifications and find out what happened here? 
 # Were Roberto's submissions actually successful? 
 # I received sorting notifications for Tobin but no registration notifications.  Why would that be

Ok that's strange, at which point did it fail? Did the files upload via Aspera and then fail in aoma or did the Aspera upload not start as expected?

Hi Roberto

I have just registered both the new 24 and 16bit masters provided in the links, keeping the naming you used without issue.

I used the method noted earlier in this email chain for Full Master registration. 

Can I just check did you use Aspera to upload the masters or the TusD or Import from Ci, Options?  

I used Aspera and the registration/swap went through as expected.

Thanks

Tobin

We would like to be autonomous for replacements, avoiding to open JIRA....could you please investigate the reason that did not let the registration go for the assets?

OK, Roberto,

Can you upload the files to the Italy Dropbox in Ci so the MP team can access the files and register these for you? Let us know if you need an upload link.

Hi Fiona

The first upload we tried had the correct track names (see the attached mail) but it failed

So we tried the second upload with a ""fake title"" (a letter)

Thanks!

Hi Roberto,

You should be able to handle via the UST Asset Swap.Open up the master you'd like to update in UST, and either replace the track(s) one at at ime via the ""Asset Swap"" button inline with each track, or compile a ""Full Master."" Clicking that button will display the message below, ""Would you like to swap the registered assets?"" If you choose Full Master, please ensure that the file-names in the folder are set correctly.

*UST, Full Master track naming convention*

For Full Master, it also requires the component to be added and should look like this:

01_02.wav 

01_03.wav

We published the following album last week:

 
|*G010005377572E*|196872492385|*Nicola Siciliano*|SKUGNIZZO|

 

Marketing has just told us we have to replace the WAVs of ALL the 15 tracks because there are little changes in the voice mix (duration is not changed in every track)

Just a question: can we do ""master create"" in AOMA (one for 16 bit, one for 24 bit) and when registered we perform the hot swaps? We will avoid to create a JIRA

Could you please check this out when you get chance? I can see the asset swaps in Master and Product Event History, but not Registration Job Status. I'm assuming that's why Mike C. isn't getting the registration-specific notifications? 

Thanks,

Keith;;;","22/Nov/24 9:24 PM;spag001;Hi all,

Will check this out.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","22/Nov/24 10:17 PM;spag001;Hi [~mcatande],

The notification received was the correct one, it's just the user name was the problem. For the wav 16 full master info notification we normally set the user to who is listed as the registration job. For swaps (for whatever reason in the past) it set up to not update the registrationJobUser. (Also to note for swaps we will re-use the existing registrationJob as its not being cleared just updated.)

This can easily be updated if it leads to more confusion. We can then change the logic to always take the user who registered the last item to the product and update the registrationJob accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions or if I missed something else in this thread.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","22/Nov/24 10:50 PM;mcatande;Thanks [~SPAG001] - I think we should change the logic.  The actual users (last updated user) should be in the messaging.;;;","02/Dec/24 11:26 PM;mcatande;Should this be assigned to me?

This product is very old so it might have published before VSC was a thing which is why the VSC being missing didn't block it at the time. It also looks like this product was involved in a backfill at some point and some data got messed up. 

I would probably recommend re-registering the assets to a new master and swapping them in to fix this product.


Thanks

It looks to have been a weird intermediate issue but let me check with the teams. Lowering priority since the resubmit went through.

Hi mc team,

The failure for this job we received from amp was due to ""Asset input data has been changed after processing started"". When we checked with amp team on this failure it was mentioned that this error reported if S3 object's LastModified value is changed after asset processing has started, which means any modification may have happen to the input data. Could you check if any modification to the file/metadata occurred after the conversion was marked as successful?

 # The file names contained Korean characters (special characters). 
 # The codec of the asset was unusual 'Canopus HQX' 

MediaInfo was able to read the info fine.... Not sure why this would have failed?  I would expect an error of ""Attribute Value Nul"" to mean that there was header data missing that could not be read... but that shouldn't be the case with this file...

The actual missing data that the system is complaining about is the lack of SME_Format_Profile on the descriptor file.

Can you check the ISRC difference also? For example, LC shows track 2 with an ISRC of USSM22400637. The master linked has an ISRC of USSM22400637 but the Details UI shows an ISRC difference between the product (USSM22400636) and the master. (USSM22400637).  Note, we have unlinked the virtual masters and imported the metadata.

Looks like some of the data in the descriptor file is not getting captured correctly. I'll create a fix ticket to enhance the messaging here.

The actual error is that the SME_Format_Profile seems to be missing. I also did notice that the SME_FORMAT is coming up as av01 which I believe we don't support. 

Hi gmp team,

Can you review this one? I've attached the full descriptor file here.

Subject: The Flip64 transcode has aborted due to an inactivity timeout

Hi team,
 
I tried to register the two following video’s yesterday:
Product #
Title
Main Artist
G0100053349554
Overvloed
Genna, Jiri11
G010005334995P

Genna feat. Kaya Imani
 
I got the same error for both:
“The Flip64 transcode has aborted due to an inactivity timeout”
 
I am not able to resubmit the upload and the current status is: ManualQcInprogress
 
Could you please have a look and advise what I should do to fix this. These video’s should be ready by the end of the day.
 
Thanks for your help.

I believe the missing auto-correct option is actually a minor bug on the UST side. Looks like there was a bug reading the file ext for this mp4s. (If file ext can't be determined or isn't an accepted one we don't allow auto-correction as its a hard fail case). Gonna push a fix for that later tonight.

The reason is same as interruption happened during transferor app running which cause the app to stop running.

The clip info is missing due UST skipping the clip generation step in DSD registrations. As discussed on the GMP chat I think we want that back so I've linked the fix ticket for that. Once that fix ticket is released we will backfill clips data to affected products.

So yesterday AOMA logged me out while I was uploading a SFV to the UST. 

This seemed to fail the upload. After logging back in, there was no sign of it in the Notifications panel anymore but the UST interface still said ""Asset Upload in Progress"". 

I had to manually cancel the upload and do it again. 

This happened under G0100053692289. 

For the job to disappear from the Notifications panel after logging back in is concerning. 

I think this is something that the team should be aware of and possible investigate. 

Thanks!

CT 4202 requires the full video to be selected, as it is intended solely for source (full) video. The clips 'Preview' and 'Program Only' require at least one CT ID other than 4202. Since CT 4202(Copy Conversion) functions only with the full video, it cannot be used to export the 'Preview' or 'Program Only' clips.

To resolve this, you can either export the full video using CT 4202, or use a different CT ID (other than 4202) to export the 'Preview' or 'Program Only' clips.

There looks to be a bug with how video bundles are populating this table leading into the above error.  

As we continue to investigate this, db team from the backend could you update the statuses of the VICs to proceed. After this is done the product should go through correctly.

All 22 tracks were present in my MBC export to Ci. Looks like the system is grabbing some tracks off of the same 60's compilation products, so only 18 products are being used for the 22 tracks. This is being incorrectly reflected in the UI - will get a ticket together to have it fixed.

Could you please review? Looks like the product count data is incorrect in this scenario. It should say something more like, ""Displaying 22 of 22 tracks"" when we're submitting just ISRCs. Or ""Displaying 22 tracks from 18 products,"" something like that. The current wording gives the incorrect notion that tracks are missing from the group.

Hi Mac,

Just an update: we checked your list with the corresponding results in MBC and the batch ID: 989 in the AOMA export list. You should have received the tracks noted below, bar the three that are highlighted. We’ll check into these three tracks and get back to you.

FYI, some tracks were delivered under the same Job ID and product number. For example, Job ID: 37754 (product: G0100053163140) contains three tracks.

I’ve pulled these tracks from Aoma. However, I’ve been noticing while doing this that the MBC doesn’t seem to be getting all of the tracks:

Adding another example of this issue from the UK Licensing team here. The product count not matching the track count is throwing off the users - they're not opening all of the products up individually on the UI to see that multiple tracks are coming from the same product...

Will check into the three missing tracks...Terry Jacks they should definitely get, the other two appear to be SME Germany so maybe not covered under the Sync permissions.

Thanks,

This track is owned by the US (Legacy), yet MBC is attempting to pull the product only from a giant Netherlands compilation product, G010005268430B (side 1 / track 44). Shouldn't a US owned track come from a product with a US label MO? 

It brings up another point - we really shouldn't be pulling tracks from compilation products for other...compilation products.

These are owned by SME Germany and must not be opted into the Sync workflow. -Kenny V has post-release Germany access, but Mac does not.- [~BURG036] -please ask Flo off to the side tomorrow if Mac can have the post-release access for Germany, mirroring vaug009.- No need for the Germany request at this time, Fi...

UPDATE: These two SME Germany tracks are being pulled from two separate SME Spain compilation albums. As neither Kenny or Mac have access to SME Spain or Netherlands, all three tracks are not making it for either account. As Kenny noted, the A2 Batch Offerings is providing all 28 requested tracks.

Hardings fixing now slower than before due to MFC and Sony Ci,DPSA-30383,1777390,,System Error,Open,DPSA,DPS Asset Management,software,aoma-as,,,Major,,wang042,whit056,whit056,21/Oct/24 2:10 PM,01/Oct/25 5:13 PM,12/Oct/25 4:12 PM,,,,,21/Oct/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"It was brought to my attention in this morning’s UK video meeting that multiple steps required to complete a Hardings fix task are taking significantly longer using MFC and Sony Ci in comparison to our previous AOMA 2 workflow:
 # The first Hardings test AOMA submission takes 10-15 minutes before being visible at AOMA 3 Export Status using CT4100 with Media Batch Converter via Sony CI.
 # Then it takes 10-15 minute to retrieve the first Hardings test certificate which also takes time to find in the Sony Ci ‘Media Production Operations - AOMA Exports’ dropbox so that’s 30 minutes just to get our first certificate, this use to be the time it took to upload the video plus the processing time which matched the playback time of the video file being scanned before a certificate would almost instantly appear in our ‘My AOMA Files’ location.
 # For every new Hardings test it can take between 20-30 minutes for a new certificate to arrive even if the video file submitted is a only few seconds long.

Apparently the result of this is that Hardings fixes are usually taking approximately double the time but I’m pretty sure if there are tricky fixes to do it would be significantly more time based on the information Elliot has provided above.

Is there a way we can improve these timings so there isn't a risk of missing broadcast deadlines?",,alcoc02,kuma011,mcatande,pala017,rhayloc,roraj01,whit056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i2t2lb:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,whit056,,No,,,,,,,"21/Oct/24 4:27 PM;pala017;Hi [~HALE002] / [~KUMA011]  - Please check this.

Hari;;;","21/Oct/24 9:10 PM;kuma011;Hi [~WHIT056],

I have seen there was 2 batch exports from Elliot on 18th Oct, with batch id's 822 and 823. In that 822 started appearing in the A3 export status page immediately since it is productized export. But I can see there was a 10 min delay to appear 823 in the export status page, but the delay is the time it took to upload the file from Sony CI to S3.


The video file used for the 823-batch export is 5.5Gb+ and it took around 10 mins to transfer the file to S3(Which includes Metadata extraction, MD5 creation, transfer time, validation etc..). It started appearing immediately in export status page once after the transfer completed from AMP.

Details on the time taken:
Transfer from SonyCI time: 9 minutes
MD5 Calc: 1:20
Content Copy: 0:04
Total Processing time: 1:40
Total Ingestion time: 10:30

Slow Harding Test results (CT 4100) using the Media Batch converter (MBC) in AOMA ,DPSA-29879,1689912,,System Error,Open,DPSA,DPS Asset Management,software,aoma-as,,,Low,,wang042,read008,read008,05/Jun/24 8:22 PM,01/Oct/25 5:12 PM,12/Oct/25 4:12 PM,,,,,07/Jun/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"Hi Team, 

The conversion times for Harding testing (CT 4100) seem considerably longer using the Media Batch Converter (MBC) than the previous system using the Media File Converter (MFC). 

My 2 Harding tests today using the MBC took: 

1. 24mins
2. 17 mins

By contrast, the MFC test used today took 11 mins and previous MFC tests when the certificates were delivered to the Offerings folder in AOMA used to take 6-10mins. 

I have 3 queries about the MBC Harding Test system in an attempt to improve it: 

1. Is there a reason why the MBC takes twice as long as the previous MFC system? 

2. Is there anything that the MBC system can learn from the MFC system to help speed up the process? 

3. Is there any way that the MBC system can be optimised to take around 10 mins maximum for a Harding test? 

Many thanks in advance for investigating this.

Looking into this.

Thanks
Matthew;;;","22/Oct/20 9:35 PM;spag001;Hi all,

So I got some clarification on the AMP/Legacy search checking the jsonObject that AMP returns. I noticed that the master artist participant id that the artist CMP22 has in GRAS, also happens to be the value 338491. That is why those are also showing up here, but we can not change that value. Also this master is not tied to any product it should not show up in the product search. 

Thanks
 Matthew;;;","22/Oct/20 10:58 PM;kmccar1;Thanks [~SPAG001] - so it's less of a bug and more of an issue with the system returning results for the Participant Number. 

I searched 384591 (Miranda Lambert) with 2.0 and Master, and got pages of Miranda Lambert products. Theoretically, if 384591 was a video master ID registered in the system (it's not), it would be hidden among these pages of results. This would, in turn, cause some confusion for the user searching for a particular master ID via a Master search only to receive various unrelated returns. 

I'm not aware of users searching via GRAS Participant number in AOMA, but this may be worth further discussion. 

[~vcampan] please feel free to add anything that I may have missed.

Thanks everyone,

User confirmed that she re-uploaded the folder with amended file names removing the question marks ""?"" in filenames, previews generated without issues post-registration.

The question marks in the filenames were the culprit specifically for not getting the previews generated.
 
The files went through registration but caused a problem for Media Conversion to get previews generated.
 
How can we improve the system to avoid this situation?
The registration of these files [with question marks in the filename] went through registration process without issue, the problem is communication with MC for preview generation.

Yes. The Generate Preview button on the main Details UI is inactive and/or displaying the message ""You have selected one or more items that does not support playback previews. Please check your selections again."" because the UI auto-selects the parent folder besides the video file selected. The parent folder is not valid for video preview playback selection. This is an old bug. We will review best plan of action to change this, [~HALE002] either by removing the Generate Preview button on the main Details UI bar display or by disabling auto-selection of parent of folder when one ore more files inside the folder are selected.

For now, the work around is to use the Generate Preview button right next to the video or audio file asset.

Thanks,

Initially, we thought that these issues were related to Flip Action (XSC-404)

Now, we speculate that the errors are due to filepath lengths. 

As per Matt Woo's comment of DPSA-27545:
{quote}per WPTS-334181, we tried telestream's fix and were still getting the same ""failed to start"" error.

Seems to be a related issue with regards to the character length/characters in the file name of the source that fails these jobs. Original file name with 126 characters fails but the same file with a truncated filename of 59 characters passes.

MFC will not accept a filename with ""&"" in the name, so i was not able to directly test those Black Eyed Peas videos that failed (that have & in the filename) with their original filename, but a truncated version of the filename passes.

Re-tested in STAGE where the telestream changes have not been made and with the same results, original file name fails, truncated file name passes.
{quote}
On MC's side, Application limit to filename will be investigated via ACS-2818. 
[~SAMA030] please help us find the promo export file name structure from AOMA.

It should be pointing to AOMA2 details page, however after speaking with AOMA3 the support for adding this would be very simple now so that might be the better direction then fixing the icon link here.

Just to clarify UST workflow does not copy to the gmp folder, the expected flow is that the asset is downloadable from the UST UI.

AOMA Archive - Generate previews function is 'buggy' ,DPSA-27269,1266729,,System Error,Closed,DPSA,DPS Asset Management,software,aoma-as,,,Normal,Complete,wang042,mcatande,mcatande,06/Jun/22 9:58 PM,01/Oct/25 5:00 PM,12/Oct/25 4:12 PM,07/Jan/25 7:54 PM,,,,06/Jun/22 12:00 AM,0,,,,"When using the AOMA Archive and attempting to select files for the system to generate, there appear to be bugs. 

When in the archive details interface initially the ""generate previews"" button is grayed out.  one can select files and if the files are the correct type, the generate previews button will become active.  

!image-2022-06-06-15-50-58-208.png!

 

AOMA is detecting a ""folder"" or container as a ""file type"" and if any folders are selected the generate previews button is grayed out.  This behavior prevents a user from selecting all items in a folder to create previews. The Archive details interface selects the folder level is all files are selected within that folder making the generate previews button inactive.

Additionally, The lower panel should be a separate pane from the upper panel with separate scrolls so that a user can scroll the files list and see the top lower panel menu items while browsing a long list of files. for 'generate previews' to select a file from a long list of files, a user has to scroll to the file they want to generate previews for, select the file and then scroll all the way back up to the top to click 'generate previews'

As we moved to Kafka ( event driven ) Architecture ,  its very less likely we will have an messaging issue for any new updates or registrations ..
We have enabled the option to re-send EOM messages via Kafka from the UI for major or emergency cases. However, we are trying to restrict access to this feature.
Currently all AOMA support have access to re-send EOM messages ..   
 
In the last two months, have you encountered any major cases that required EOM messages to be re-sent?  I’m aware of a couple of DPSA incidents due to AOMA data issues, but the AOMA team has mostly resolved these code problems.
 
Given this, do we need to provide access to all users, or should we limit it to a select few?;;;","13/Aug/25 4:36 PM;vdutta;Hi [~gvamsik]  - 

I spoke with DPS team yesterday and we agree that at this time we should give access to few DPS team members in case they need to push asset messages in case of an emergency.

In my opinion, if a facility is being offered to a few members of the team it should be offered to all. From a support perspective, It would be extremely lame if one team member was handling an emergency off hours request and needed to contact/wait for another team member who was given the permission.

 

Thanks,
Pete;;;","14/Aug/25 7:29 PM;gvamsik;As we transition to the new architecture with Kafka for EOM messages, our goal is to eliminate the need for any manual resend activities. Any updates made in AOMA,  events should flow directly to EOM. 
 
This new flow has been live in production for over six to eight months (Phases from - DBKS to AUD-VID and Last phase of LFV  ), with no option to resend messages from users.
 
During this transition, there have been only a few instances requiring the resend option due to internal AOMA code issues, which have now been resolved. These cases were analyzed and handled by the development team. ( No pending code issues ) 
 
The only remaining scenario involves assets registered a few years ago, recently linked, and missing asset information in EOM due to old system issues (e.g., DPSO-92738).
 
I Just came to know that some labels have a workflow that involves performing a metadata import followed by sending an EOM message.  Message from one user  - “ We usually use this function when we have a rush metadata change and we effectively force it to update and go out quicker than the standard timing...Especially for fields that might not update until the weekend for example like artist credits” . 
 
However, technically, there is no reason to resend EOM messages in this Kafka workflow.
 
To ensure a smooth transition, we have enabled the EOM resend option for internal support teams to handle any emergencies. We can extend this option to all EOM support members but want to address scenarios requiring this option first.
 
Action items:
1. Implement an email functionality where the Dev team receives an email when someone uses this option, including user details.
2. Record the usage of this resend option in our history tables to track which products/masters it was used for.
3. Work with the EOM team to identify data discrepancies between AOMA and EOM for older masters.
 
These should help to address the need for manual resend options and provides visibility to resend list so that development team can investigate further . 
 
For now , we will grant re-send option to given users list and let you know. ;;;","28/Aug/25 8:52 PM;coconne;Hey there, 

On the Digital Ops side we were also using the EOM Message Sender feature in AOMA.  I pinged the team and so far folks has been ok but Laura mentioned she's constantly seeing issues of needing to push LFV assets from AOMA to EOM.   LFV products do require loads of assets.  is there any special attention that can be given to that config? I also asked Laura for examples...but so far that might be one reason we want to keep the button..

LFV was the final phase of our Kafka migration project. Issues DPSA-27713 and DPSO-66797 were older issues prior to this migration.

Since transitioning to Kafka, the only ( pending ) scenario requiring a re-send is for older assets registered couple of years before the migration. I will review AOMA-16977 to understand why a re-send was necessary and will get back .

Phil C.;;;","30/Sep/25 7:24 PM;gvamsik;We understand that the request for the entire extract (DPSRP-1822) is in progress and may take some time. We have been notified that these products are experiencing issues with asset status, preventing orders from being placed.
 
Therefore, we requested the extract of these products which is short list. This will allow us to easily analyze the missing asset information before resending messages for these products.
 
Since this is not the correct Jira to request this information, we will suggest user to create a DPSO for the error they are encountering. We can then address this in the appropriate Jira and link it accordingly.

I _think_ it may be an issue with Aspera and the parenthesis in the *Merle2(color).tif* file-name (I'm getting the same download error on my end). I was able to export via Xpress File and download the zip via HTTP. Folder has been uploaded to Ci and shared with you and Tom via automated email.

Please see the attached report from the database.

It looks like a UI issue so assigning this ticket to the dev team for further investigation.

It is security group specific. As mentioned in the comments earlier, there is something weird going on with 'All' Master Category. So I have added the Deep Storage Uploader role individually for Photo Archives, Audio Archives and Video Archives. I have completed this for all Archive SGs and for all active GMP users. Please verify.

442 formats are pass where as 4444 formats should go through the auto-correction process as per the validation document. Long term 4444 should be treated as black tail detection where if its the only error it should auto-correct but that change has not been made yet. Let me know if you have any questions.

Also just want to note the error message for that error looks like it didn't get updated with the change back. Will fix that to the old message this weekend.

As per [~prag008], this registration is part of a bulk registration request, and there was no encryption applied on our side. The file received from the user was used directly for registration, and he suspects that one of the files provided by the user might have been encrypted.

This particular booklet was converted from the old spec to pdf output and registered as dbks in a backfill.  In conversation with [~roraj01] he had noted that there are a subset of booklets with encryption in the system.

On G0100056119476 tracks 4, 7, and 12 are designated as Explicit in DX and on the product but do not display with the Explicit icon on the 24 Bit MFiT, and 24 Bit 48kHz masters in Associated Masters. The Dolby Atmos master is also missing the Explicit icon on tracks 4, 7, 12, and 14, and incorrectly displays the icon for track 13.

DX shows all tracks bar track 13 as Explicit.

Let me check this out.;;;","25/Sep/25 5:34 PM;kori002;hey [~spag001] 

Could you please check if UST registration did not inherit the Explicit indicator.

[~helm004]  and [~kmccar1]  It could possibily be a later metadata import done after registration. Because registration for 24 Bit masters were done on 24 and I could see a metadata import on 25th as well.

[~helm004]  The indicators on associated master section is more for display (informational purposes). This should not affect any of your delivery tonight. We are also coming with ability to edit the track master lyric indicator version to handle these kind of situations gracefully.

Vamsi is also looking from linking inheritance standpoint.

 # Masters inherit the lyric indicator type from the metadata during linking. In this case, lyric indicator type is updated in the metadata after linking happened.
 # Lyric indicator type shown for masters is for AOMA UI only. This doesn't flow to the downstream systems.
 # I have updated the master's lyric indicator type manually in the backend wherever there is a mismatch with metadata for the given products.
 # [~kori002] please check and create a development ticket to address this if this a valid scenario.

Maybe more of an indexing issue? Could you please take a look?

Thanks,

Keith;;;","06/Aug/25 12:59 PM;poty002;Hi [~kmccar1] [~jdunca1] 

Appreciate your observation. Here’s what we found based on our investigation:
 # *Keyword Field Mapping*

 ** *Issue:* {{masterAttributeValueKy}} was mapped as a {{text}} field using the keyword analyzer, so the entire string (e.g. Asia Podcasts - “DoReMischa"") was treated as one token.

 ** *Impact:* Searches for individual words or numbers in that field never matched.

 # *Use of Term-Level Queries*

 ** *Issue:* We were using {{terms}} queries against text fields, which require exact term matches.

 ** *Impact:* Full-text searches (phrases, CamelCase, punctuation) returned no or unrelated results. e.g (Podcast ID: 183 - never match).

 # *Analyzer Tokenization*

 ** *Issue:* The standard analyzer doesn’t split CamelCase or punctuation-based strings in the way we expect.

 ** *Impact:* Queries like “DoReMischa” or “Podcast ID: 183” weren’t broken into searchable tokens.

 # *Query Field List*

 ** *Issue:* Our {{multi_match}} clause included only the {{{}Ctx{}}}/{{{}Tx{}}} variants, not the {{Ky}} field or any n-gram/keyword sub-fields.

 ** *Impact:* Relevant values in {{masterAttributeValueKy}} were never searched.

 
*Next Steps to Resolve*
 * *Remap* {{masterAttributeValueKy}} as a true {{keyword}} or add a {{.text}} sub-field with an edge-ngram analyzer.

 * *Replace* {{terms}} queries with {{{}match{}}}/{{{}match_phrase{}}} for text searches and {{term}} for exact keyword matches.

 * *Enhance* tokenization by introducing an n-gram or whitespace analyzer on a sub-field.

 * *Update* our search queries to include the new {{.keyword}} and/or {{.ngram}} variants in the {{multi_match}} field list.

Once these changes are in place and the data is reindexed, Podcast searches by title, keywords, and ID will return consistent, relevant results. 
We’ve created a ticket for the development, we will pick it up for implementation ASAP. 

Thank you,
Igor

Looking at the source file supplied, I can see that the video and audio codecs do not meet our submission guidelines:

!image-2025-09-23-09-56-48-832.png!

In addition to this, the pixel aspect ratio of the video is HD Anamorphic 1.33:1 (which is why the resolution is 1440x1080) when require a HD video to have square pixels.

On a side note, the audio level peaks at -10.1dB which is very quiets so I would also consider raising the audio levels to peak between 0dB and -3dB.

I've updated the RCA in ACS-3651. In short, this is the edge case caused by incomplete workflow, which shows failed in Workflow Designer, but in progress in the API call.
To fix this, we can simply fill the gap between the orphan action tile and the sync action tile at the end.

 ;;;","29/Aug/25 1:56 AM;venu001;Just transplanting what I read in the Teams chats to the comments:

It looks like the user/Rebecca was looking to send a large sized SFV in multiple formats (2 of which were Vantage). Large sized assets are expected to take longer than most to complete.

However, this SFV was in HD format, and the 2 Vantages she selected were also converting to HD format as well....this was unnecessary as the format was already the same. Instead, it was better to use source copy CT 4202, OR download straight from the details pages. Unfortunately, I was in transit/traveling while I was asked later this evening, but it looks like Rohit was able to communicate this with her. I think this should be good now, and there are new job submissions per below screenshot by Justin. We will monitor.

{*}EDIT{*}: In addition to Vitaliy's above duplicate Export fix, I will be making a ticket to warn a user when the format of the source asset is the same as a selected CT; this warning modal will also display the size of the asset (should only warn when its above 50G);;;","01/Sep/25 1:35 PM;stef003;Hi, 
prepared a fix for multiple duplicated export job submissions,
thanks;;;","09/Sep/25 11:29 PM;venu001;Spoke with Rebecca on this, and the main cause of concern here was the size of the file, as well as her being relatively new to Sony. There were only 4 members on her team when the request came, so this was more of a result of them scrambling to get it over to PBS (and ultimately them clicking a bunch of buttons).

As mentioned earlier, the warning for the file size (as well as logic we already have in place for duplicate Exports) should prevent needless requests from coming in more than needed. And with same source format of file-CT output format submissions, we can prevent long wait times and needless choking of the MC and Delivery systems.

Also, AOMA Support submitted multiple Exports on Rebecca's end when they noticed it wasn't going through, hence the fix ticket Vitaliy is creating. Finally, there is a zipping process which is causing for long queue times....Promo team is looking into this, as zipping in DMD happens on their end.;;;","24/Sep/25 3:25 AM;venu001;Vitaliy's duplicate Export fix is now in PROD; will close this once we put the Vantage checks in;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prelight indicated no issues with the file. 

I submitted the file and the interface looked like this:

A more clear version is available in the folder linked earlier. 

Can we fix the messaging here? Maybe have a breakout on these? Additionally, the source file was a layered Tif image.  We need to look into why Preflight didn't detect any issues.  We need to look into why secondary validation threw the disparate errors of missing header information when the real issue is that the file is layered.

 # There are messaging updates required in the e-mail notification

The Example Mohammed shows in his comment [https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/DPSA-30680?focusedCommentId=5401136&focusedId=5401136&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-5401136] 

Is a file run through what I think is AOMA Preflight (could be secondary, I don't know)? The results returned show there is no readable header data, but using a desktop app and ""get info"" there is clearly data. 

If I had more information on the tools being used and the output data, I may be able to advise fields specific to the tool on the contingency I could run it against sample assets.  Or... Maybe we should have a breakout meeting to run a bunch of assets, look at the fields and match them to our file data nomenclature.  

Also... I was under the impression we're using both MediaInfo and ImageMagick for analysis.  The screenshot Mohammed shared looks like it's just MediaInfo? 

Also from that screenshot, I see ""COVER_VALIDATION_MAPPING:WARNING:Current Media Type not supported"" It was a TIFF file right?  Why would it return ""not supported""? ;;;","06/Feb/25 7:48 PM;hale002;Hi [~SIYA001]

As discussed on teams , UST - preflight is using imagemagik version 7.0.8-45 & AMP is using 7.1.1-23, Preflight is detecting the values which AMP is not, In this case i guess there needs to be an analysis on which version of imagemagik we need to be using ?



Below is the screenshot on why preflight did not flag the source file, the hilighted files were returning as not detected from AMP

For the next Quarterly Report, I request a few more changes:

1) Add a column for cost center (attached the sheet which has mapping)

2) Add a column for company code (attached the sheet which has mapping)

3) Add a column to calculate Total Upload Cost (CQ) using the formula below:

=([@[last_quarter_file_size_standard_gb]]+[@[last_quarter_file_size_glacier_gb]]+[@[last_quarter_file_size_glacier_deep_archive_gb]])*$140/1000

4) Add a column to calculate Total Download Cost (CQ) using the formula below:

=[@[export_size_gb]]*$140/1000

5) Add a column to calculate Total Storage Cost (CQ Uploads)

=([@[last_quarter_file_size_standard_gb]]*$24*3+[@[llast_quarter_file_size_glacier_gb]]*$5*3+[@[last_quarter_file_size_glacier_deep_archive_gb]]*$2*3)/1000

6) Add a column to calculate Total Storage Cost (Prior Uploads)

[@[prior_to_last_quarter_file_size_gb]]*$5*3/1000

7) Add a column to calculate the Total Cost (sum of #3, #4, #5 and #6

Thank you,

Rohit ;;;","10/Dec/24 8:44 PM;roraj01;[~sira001] ,

I want to have the upload cost broken by the method of upload/transfer.

Total Data Transferred from Ci to DA

Total Data Transferred from S3 to DA

Total Data Uploaded from Local to DA via TUSD

Total Data Uploaded from Local to DA via Aspera.. 

The Upload cost should only consider total data uploaded via Aspera (option 4) X $140/TB

Happy to discuss with you if you have any questions. Currently TUSD is in progress so production doesn't have anything specific to TUSD. anything coming from Local is all Aspera traffic.

In addition, any current and past storage cost should also be calculated based on the storage option selected by a user for those upload:

New Uploads

1) If S3 was selected (default) -> $25/TB/Month (*3 Months)

2) If Glacier was selected -> $5/TB/Month (*3 Months)

OR 3) If Glacier Deep was selected -> $2/TB/Month (*3 Months)

Past Uploads

1) If S3 was selected (default) -> $5/TB/Month (*3 Months)

2) If Glacier was selected -> $5/TB/Month (*3 Months)

OR 3) If Glacier Deep was selected -> $2/TB/Month (*3 Months);;;","15/Jan/25 10:52 PM;sira001;Thank you [~PALA017] for helping me with the columns required for the calculations.

total_upload_cost_cq should be local_da_aspera_size_gb/1000 x $140/TB

 

prior_to_last_quarter_file_size_gb should be broken down in three categories
prior_to_last_quarter_file_size_standard_gb    
prior_to_last_quarter_file_size_glacier_gb    
prior_to_last_quarter_file_size_glacier_deep_archive_gb

Just putting this on your radar in case it is a new TusD issue. We were unable to register this 24 Bit 48kHz WAV file via TusD in Prod and Stage: PUSO AT ISIP 24BIT.wav.

Note, we were able to register this file without issue via Import from Sony CI in Prod and via Aspera in Stage.

assuming this is label copy related; the ""is_play_time_relevant"" and ""audio_src_encoding"" flags per WPTS-449833 and WPTS-450464.

a very common issue we used to see a lot but haven't seen in the past 5 years.

5.1 tracks are flagged properly and are skipped on import, but not the atmos tracks. the last atmos track was removed from label copy, thus 22 tracks instead of 23 importing incorrectly.

thanks.;;;","11/Sep/25 10:46 PM;sira001;Hi [~kmccar1] ,

Regards,

Vinodhan;;;","11/Sep/25 10:49 PM;woom001;This still imports with 45 tracks instead of 23.

It does not meet any exclusion criteria in the reprocessing layer. 
I have also checked legacy logic (GRAS Export), and it exports 45 tracks.  

Exclusion rules:

Thanks,
Alem;;;","12/Sep/25 7:06 PM;dewi013;Hi [~zeki001] 

Using two tracks from this product, are you able to tell us what is the difference?

GBLTP2500094 is the 5.1 encoding version and is being successfully excluded in line with the 'exclude' criteria above.
GBLTP2500117 is the Dolby Atmos version that is set up exactly the same apart from the Audio Encoding value but is *not* being excluded in line with the 'exclude' criteria above.

Victor and I are confused about how one is meeting the exclude criteria and the other is not when they are the same.

 

Trudi;;;","12/Sep/25 7:25 PM;zeki001;Hi [~dewi013], 

There are a few relevant extracts from the JSON response. 

Product configuration:

 
{code:java}
    ""configuration"": {
        ""configKey"": ""C9"",
        ""name"": ""Digital Video Longform"",
        ""shortName"": ""DDVDV"",
        ""isDVD"": false,
        ""isDMD"": true,
        ""isMISupported"": true,
        ""sideCnt"": 1,
        ""isSingleTrack"": false,
        ""mediaType"": {
            ""key"": ""3"",
            ""title"": ""Multimedia""
        }
    } {code}
 

Track GBLTP2500094:
{code:java}
            ""skipNo"": 0,
            ""isTrkDurationRelevant"": false,
            ""srcAudioEncode"": {
                ""key"": ""29"",
                ""title"": ""5.1 channel""
            }
            ""trackMediaKey"": {
                ""key"": ""2"",
                ""title"": ""Video""
            } {code}
Track GBLTP2500117;
{code:java}
            ""skipNo"": 0,
            ""isTrkDurationRelevant"": false,
            ""srcAudioEncode"": {
                ""key"": ""47"",
                ""title"": ""Dolby Atmos Video""
            }
            ""trackMediaKey"": {
                ""key"": ""2"",
                ""title"": ""Video""
            } {code}
And, I think, this is a rule that you are targeting :
 * Skip number is equal to 0
 * and media type key is 2
 * and source encoding key is 29
 * and play time relevant flag is false
 * and config key is C9. 

There is no OR operator. All operators are AND - all subconditions must be met.

Track GBLTP2500094 meets all conditions: 
 * skip number is 0
 * media type key is 2 - Video 
 * audio source encoding key is 29 - 5.1 channel
 * play time relevant flag is false 
 * product configuration is C9 Digital Video Longform

Track GBLTP2500117 meets the following conditions: 
 * skip number is 0
 * media type key is 2 - Video 
 * play time relevant flag is false 
 * product configuration is C9 Digital Video Longform

But, it doesn't meet this one: 
 * audio source encoding key is 29 - 5.1 channel. 

For this one track, the audio source encoding key is 47 - Dolby Atmos Video. 

If you want to exclude 47 - Dolby Atmos Video in a combination with the rest of the subconditions, we need to update our reprocessing logic.

The current logic is legacy from GRAS Export and doesn't consider 47 - Dolby Atmos Video. Actually, it considers only the 29 - 5.1 channel. 

Or, if you don't want to consider the audio source encoding key in general, but want to consider the rest of the subconditions, we also need to update reprocessing logic. 

Thanks,
Alem

 ;;;","12/Sep/25 7:34 PM;vcampan;Sounds like all we need to do is add ""audio source encoding key is 47 - Dolby Atmos Video"" to the exclusion criteria and we'll be good.;;;","12/Sep/25 7:37 PM;zeki001;I found tickets with more details:

We definitely need to update this logic to include the new Dolby Atmos audio source encoding key as an exclude parameter.

We have implemented a reprocessing layer as a lambda function. Since we don't need to make any updates to the RDX query, we will update it. 
I'll let you know once we are done. 

This is a ticket for fixing this:

This is a general fix for all tracks with skip no 0, media type key 2 - Video, product configuration C9 - Digital Video Longform, play time relevant flag set to false, and audio source encoding key 47 - Dolby Atmos Video. It's not only a workaround for the G0100056311556 product. 

We changed rule to: 

""Skip number is equal to 0, and media type key is 2, and source encoding key is {*}in (29, 47){*}, and play time relevant flag is false, and config key is C9"".

If there is any avenue to query directly, that would be the ideal scenario.",,abonnin,sira001,stra002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"07/Apr/25 10:36 PM;abonnin;AOMA_Exports_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2470949/AOMA_Exports_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx","07/Apr/25 10:36 PM;abonnin;AOMA_Linking_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2470950/AOMA_Linking_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx","07/Apr/25 10:36 PM;abonnin;AOMA_Registrations_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2470948/AOMA_Registrations_Aug2024_13Mar25.xlsx","17/Jun/25 11:25 PM;sira001;AOMA_Usage_Reports_06172025.zip;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2569324/AOMA_Usage_Reports_06172025.zip","07/Apr/25 10:47 PM;abonnin;Reference Tables MASTER.xlsx;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2470947/Reference+Tables+MASTER.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3aswn:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Additional Requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Excellent,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,"30/Apr/25 9:10 PM;abonnin;[~sira001] do you have any thoughts as to how this could be accomplished?;;;","30/Apr/25 9:14 PM;sira001;[~abonnin] ,

I apologize for the delay on this. I have ran a custom job and sent the reports to your email for the time period between 13-Mar-2025 and yesterday. Please review and let me know if you need any changes.

I have also scheduled this report such that the weekly reports are sent to your email every Sunday evening.

My team and I are working on setting up Athena and Quicksight visualizations on top of AOMA DB's daily s3 backups. I will get back to you with a solution soon for on-demand access.

Are you able to combine the A2 & A3 exports into one data set for the automated email? If not, I can merge them on my side. Last, is it possible for you to send separate emails for each report? For now, it will be easier for the automation on my side to take the email attachment, automatically add it to a sharepoint folder, and then append all files in that folder to my data model.

This will be asset and / or hot swaps for cover files only. 

Thanks,

Keith;;;","10/Sep/25 6:59 PM;ande071;Hey Fiona 

 

field description is sufficient - just need the list asap - since we have a partner.

 

That is not ingesting the asset swaps performed -> automatically and we want to prevent releases, from going live with temporary artworks, in the future.

if such instances exist, in their delivery feed.

key target is fast delivery - details can be sparse, to speed up execution.;;;","10/Sep/25 7:07 PM;kmccar1;Hi [~ande071],

Do you have an example product that we can check? Initial investigation by the database team returned no swaps submitted by your account. They'd like to take a look to see what we're missing. 

Thanks,

Keith;;;","10/Sep/25 7:16 PM;ande071;Ok – understand.

Can the team track if an AOMA user is performing an asset swap –
on published products in AOMA’s unified submission tool?

Regards,

Deepak;;;","08/Aug/25 4:35 PM;mcatande;As. far as we can tell this is repeat behavior in the system.  It could be isolated to S3 imports. 

Looks like possibly, if the folder you select is nested in another folder (or deeper in many folders), the archive will create folder with the name you selected, then it will start at the top level folder and create the same nested structure on the origin S3.  

For Example:
 * I have a folder on S3 I want to select and archive called ""ArchiveProject1"" 
 * ""ArchiveProject1"" is on S3 nested within two other folders, path: s3://Backup/AprilForBackup/ArchiveProject1/
 * The archive will register and create a path with the top level folder name as desired/intended but then it replicates the nested files looking like Archive://ArchiveProject1/Backup/AprilForBackup/ArchiveProject1/ 
 * Nesting the desired folder and assets in a series of unwanted and empty folders.

If it helps, the dpi was originally 300 for those 2 VCAs. AOMA kicked out an email notifying me that the dpi needed to be lowered. So, I made those revisions to all 4 images and proceeded from there.;;;","02/Sep/25 11:49 PM;kmccar1;* Original images failed validation. Just a quick and dirty theory - the error message presented isn't the one intended. 

could not execute statement; SQL [n/a]; constraint [product_track_id"" of relation ""product_track_links] = the dpi is incorrect

The G010005645494K file failed last week due to a vantage issue. I'll reach out with MC team to review this one but I would probably also confirm there isnt any issues with the file.

As for G010005637761E job it looks like yesterday a pod restart caused an issue with the job in question. Still looking into the full cause of the restart but in the meanwhile gonna fail this one so we can trigger a new upload with the auto-corrected asset.

Thanks

Ah apologies I misread one of the logs for this one. Looks like the original file here had an issue on upload which caused the file to be invalid. The auto-correct option should not have been provided to the user so that's a bug will check on our side.

Can you review these files. I have uploaded the files under your migration folder under the name DPSA-25303.

Thanks

There's nothing wrong with the PDF files. Only thing that might be failing it is the size of 45MB. It most likely times out for that reason but there's nothing wrong with these files. Can this be registered via back end?

As a workaround to this problem, adding all the files to the zip bundle and registering should allow the registration to go through. We will need to have a discussion on the long term solution to this issue.

Unfortunately I am not sure there is another workaround to this issue at the moment. To view the previews the master could be export to the user local share and they can download the zip file to see the pdfs. Let me check to see if there is another solution.

Matthew;;;","16/Sep/20 11:33 PM;spag001;Hi all,

So an alternative solution is that if we are provided a revised version of the pdfs (black and white should suffice) we can register those pdfs with the master. Then post registration we can replace those pdfs/md5 files in the back-end with the actual pdf files. 

Though I will note that the previews will not be created in the backend when we do this swap.

Thanks

I got the package folder for which the error is being thrown. But the package has a lot of files in it. Also I am seeing that three of the four errors posted above are for a jpeg file and there is no jpeg file in the folder provided to me. The last error has the pdf file 000014348746_SL_PS_01_01_01_001001.pdf. I tried running the conversion and it created the descriptor file on my local environment as well as prod environment. It works fine and the conversion is successful creating the descriptor.xml file.

It would be helpful If I get the actual files for which the error are being thrown so that I can get to the root cause of the issue.

""Failed to initialise downsample filter, downsampling aborted Subsample filter does not support non-integer downsample factor (1.993028)""

-Jackie;;;","16/Mar/20 11:04 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

This is a file and the tool issue. I did some analysis and research regarding this ticket. This issue is regarding the downsampling of the pdf image to reduce it size. There is some intermediate conversion type being called which uses the GhostScript to down sample the PDF.

The PDF has a monochrome image which, according to the GhostScript, can only be down sampled using some internal tool called Subsample. But Subsample does not work in case the sampling factor is not an integer. It is also not rounding off the value to nearest integer, neither will it let the user do it. Hence we get the following error :-
""The only Downsample filter for monochrome images is Subsample, ignoring request.
Subsample filter does not support non-integer downsample factor (1.999991)
Failed to initialise downsample filter, downsampling aborted"".

I have also tried using the latest version of GhostScript which uses something called Bicubic for sampling of the image. Unfortunately monochrome images can be sampled using Subsample only. So the tool throws the following error :-
""The only Downsample filter for monochrome images is Subsample, ignoring request.""

I have captured the command used by Media Conversion application which is as follows :-

C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.20\bin\gswin64c.exe -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dNOPAGEPROMPT -dSHORTERRORS -dBATCH -dUseCropBox -sDEVICE#pdfwrite -sOutputFile#C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-system-test-svc\testsources\DPSA_24755-gs.pdf -sOwnerPassword#smepreview -dEncryptionR#3 -dKeyLength#128 -dPermissions#-3900 -c .setpdfwrite ""[/Title (Death Stranding (Original Score)) /Author (Ludvig Forssell) /Subject (Digital PDF Booklet) /Keywords (Sony Music Entertainment Inc.)  /DOCINFO pdfmark "" -f C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-wip\.\profiles\prod\arvato\Ghostscript\DistillerSettings\000002.joboptions C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-system-test-svc\testsources\DPSA_24755.pdf

So I guess this will only fail when the image is a monochrome and the sampling rate is not an integer.

Also I am attaching the following links that I referred to get this Information :-

Shreyas Kamthe;;;","17/Mar/20 4:27 PM;cabe004;Hi Shreyas,

I tired to re-export the PDF of sleeve page 1 and the overlay of the red circle on the image is showing pink instead of the red. That overlay is a spot pearlescent which is for a metallic overlay for printing. 

Is there any way to add a line of code to treat monochrome images as a black & white image and see if that works? 

Otherwise, I recommend adding the sleeve page 1 file to the zip bundle and registering it that way. I'm unsure if the label can do anything to change their export that won't fail for a monochrome image again.

-Jackie ;;;","17/Mar/20 6:04 PM;kamt001;Hey Jackie,

Media Conversion as an application does not access the source file. All the conversion changes to the source file are being done only by the tool (in this case GhostScript). So any code change won't help in this case.

I have captured the following command I am trying to play with it a little bit to figure out how to either ignore the monochrome image or treat it like a black and white image.

C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.20\bin\gswin64c.exe -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dNOPAGEPROMPT -dSHORTERRORS -dBATCH -dUseCropBox -sDEVICE#pdfwrite -sOutputFile#C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-system-test-svc\testsources\DPSA_24755-gs.pdf -sOwnerPassword#smepreview -dEncryptionR#3 -dKeyLength#128 -dPermissions#-3900 -c .setpdfwrite ""[/Title (Death Stranding (Original Score)) /Author (Ludvig Forssell) /Subject (Digital PDF Booklet) /Keywords (Sony Music Entertainment Inc.)  /DOCINFO pdfmark "" -f C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-wip\.\profiles\prod\arvato\Ghostscript\DistillerSettings\000002.joboptions C:\Users\kamt001\Documents\Projects\dockerized-media-conversion\base-maven\sme-mc-system-test-svc\testsources\DPSA_24755.pdf

This command works perfectly fine (i.e. it throws the exact error that is being thrown by media conversion) and only needs the modification of the paths mentioned (as these paths are specific to my local machine).

Please let me know if you find out any parameter to be set in this command which may solve the issue.

I'm not seeing a folder with that name in migration.

This is for the sbusdata account in PROD, correct?

my AOMA account has never been used and is disabled. Can you move the folder to sbusdata migration?

this is the master file for the feature. we are looking specifically for the original CT3007 preview file that Media Library generated for this registration. It's an mp4 file. We need to view that file, as it's the one that's bad, and know what the origination date was, was it July 17, 2020 or Jan 31 2020, etc.

thanks.;;;","28/Jul/20 1:23 AM;bsahoo1;Hi Matt,

This master file's time stamp shows *Jul 17 21:28* on the isilon. I'm sure the preview must have been generated on the same date. Mlib team has cleared the exiting previews and submitted request for regenerating the preview. It's in process currently. I will check with Mlib team and have the CT3007 preview file copied to sbusdata's migration tomorrow.

Thanks.;;;","28/Jul/20 8:29 PM;bsahoo1;Hi [~WOOM001],

I have uploaded the preview file generated for feature video. Please have a look.

the new file is now stereo. But it's still unclear why the first preview was only in one channel, an issue only found in the old ffmpeg version that was in use.

Just to confirm, what are the versions of FFMPEG currently in use across Media Library?;;;","29/Jul/20 12:48 AM;bsahoo1;[~WOOM001] as per my understanding FFMPEG software is currently being used during conversion by the conversion system.

[~sdonipu], [~RICH014], Could you please let Matt know which versions of FFMPEG are currently being used in media conversion system and for which CTs?
Also is there any upgrade applied to the software after July 17th?

Thanks,
Brajesh;;;","29/Jul/20 1:12 AM;sdonipu;Hi Brajesh,

Looking into this. 

Thanks,
Sharada;;;","29/Jul/20 2:51 AM;sdonipu;Hi [~WOOM001],

Please find below, the grid for all of the active FFMPeg CTs and the corresponding version of the FFmpeg tool used for transcoding both video tiers. I have added a separate row for each CT <=> VideoTier when there are 2 commands with mixed versions of the encoding.  All of the below example command logs are pulled from 07/27 and 07/28 dated conversion requests

Please let us know if you need any more information.

 

Hi [~bsahoo1] – RE: Upgrade of the tool after July 17th ---- We will check our release notes and get back if there was any build around the same time.

Here's the logic we shall use to retrieve the VSC master ids:

-> Get the full published product

    --> if only one found -> get the VSC master id

    --> If more than one found -> get the one with most recent video registration

    --> If none found -> Check rest of the product for VSC and take the VSC from the product that has most recent video registration

VLC also does not open the file and the media info window indicates it is MPEG2.  This has been escalated Richard Haylock.  I expect similar issues with all of them. ;;;","22/Nov/21 6:01 PM;pcharle;Checking in.;;;","23/Nov/21 8:06 PM;rhayloc;The three specific products G010002876390W, G010003062252E, G0100030823744 are actually corrupt files so we cannot correct them..

PFA [^VSC_Track_Linking_113021.xlsx] having Video Tracks which needs VSC Linking. 

Added VIC timecode, VIC Status for the Video Products. Few Products are having VSC Master ID(which I included in the sheet) is not registered. Also added Publish Status for the Products(which are from DX system).

Let me know if you need any details.

Was there any recent changes the naming of db entries for CTs - 2052, 22052, 32052? The AOMA logic for export looks to take the display name from the each of the CT's for the names shown here.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","01/Mar/22 9:14 PM;spag001;Hi all,

Quick update, it looks like this actually isn't a naming issue we are getting the same result back three times. When I submitted conversion requests with the three above options they all used the 32052 CT. The call to grab this list should be going through the jar and is from the following call in the conversion project.

Neither Jackie nor I were involved in the process of creating this CT so we have no details of what it actually does absent reviewing the input and output and hoping we properly deconstruct what we think the conversion is doing.

If you still have the same error, then I'll open a support ticket to Telestream since the error message is from their application.

 *Subject:* Workflow failed at Deploy action after Cloud flip

 

Hi Mike,

 

We recently received a production alert for our cloud flip workflow. It looks like the cloud flip itself completed with no error, but the subsequent deploy action failed with this message: 
 10.01.2022 16:37:33        Transport            GTSMEWVE07805            Info

Transport Session: Unable to transport media: System.Net.WebException: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.

  !image-2022-01-10-12-03-54-677.png!

This workflow worked until Jan 04, 2022, and suddenly started to fail on Jan 07, 2022. There’s been no workflow change from our side since Aug 26, 2021. I’ve checked the request, and it looks ok to me, also, the target folder for the deploy action is accessible with no issue.

  !image-2022-01-10-12-04-00-919.png!

The trace log for the Transport service says the same error message, so I restarted the Transport service and then restarted the failed job, still the same error.

  !image-2022-01-10-12-04-05-972.png!

!image-2022-01-10-12-04-13-912.png!

The job was successfully converted from the Vantage Cloud port page, so by compiling all the information that I have, I think it failed at downloading stage from the Telestream cloud to the local machine.

However, the error message doesn’t provide any helpful information to resolve this. Can you help us troubleshoot or show us how to extract the actual error?

Also, can you open a support ticket for this?

 

Thanks!

Charlie

Hi Mike,

 

There have been some windows updates since Jan 04, and our infrastructure vendor maintains them. And based on the name, they are all security patches for Microsoft Endpoint, which means they should have nothing to do with the system settings. Please see the below screenshot.

  !image-2022-01-10-13-59-45-667.png!

 

Also, there is no UseExternalTransportProcess  key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Telestream\Soa

  !image-2022-01-10-13-59-51-181.png!

Let me know if you need anything else from my side to help determine the issue.

Thanks!

Charlie,

  I just ran a similar job on my end the Deploy action was successful. Were there are Windows Updates installed recently or any changes that you can think of around that timeframe?

 

Can you let me know if the following registry key ‘UseExternalTransportProcess ‘ is present in the following path?

 

HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Telestream\Soa

 

Thanks,

Since this is a convert job the wav 16 job will wait for the wav 24 to finish up before finishing up. Wav 16 job has finished up correctly but it seems the wav 24 job has been stuck in conversion.

Hi conversion team,

Can you check out this conversion request in production, it seems to be stuck for a bit.

I am unable to access AOMA PROD UI. Is it down? OR Is there any maintenance going on?

Thanks,
Sharada.;;;","26/Oct/21 6:00 PM;sdonipu;please share the requestCds for both of the jobs - Audio WAV 24 and Audio Wav 16. We will investigate and get back.;;;","26/Oct/21 6:17 PM;spag001;Hi Sharada, 

Production is up at the moment, I am able to log in fine. (Might be a VPN issue). As per the wav 16 job that has finished a while back already, AOMA side logic is just holding it until they above WAV 24 job finishes up.

*Here is is the earlier request info for the wav 16 job :*

requestId"":""218867762

requestCd"":""US_REGISTRATION_1966521_12

*Wav 24 job request information was this request (stuck job):*

requestId"":""218867768"",

""requestCd"":""US_REGISTRATION_WAV_1966522_12""

I should also note there are other conversions tied to the product but those seems to have finished up (1-12 tracks). It looks like just this track 12 here has been stuck.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","26/Oct/21 7:26 PM;sdonipu;Hi [~SPAG001],

https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/ACS-2244 is created to troubleshoot the RC. At a glance, the WAV 24 job is not picked up by the QM and not delegated to a WIP to process the encode post yesterday's system maintenance. Looks like the pooling of ""Cache for Processing"" jobs is not working as expected. We will get back with more details once we have RC.

As per discussion we are going to manually fail the wav24 job and resubmit the files to a new registrationJob. Will keep you updated when that processes.

It looks like when AOMA jumped from 2.9.0 to 2.14.0/1  following code is changed and causing the issue 

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

In order to fix this issue MC team need coordinated debug session of AOMA code which is responsible to create package 

Package has ""customCropSettings"": null, which is causing this issue.  Need to know which data should be used or how AOMA or MC can pick up default data for Vantage conversions.

Can you also check if there is any firewall change or infrastructure change regarding the TLS/SSL for this server: gtsmewve07805.server.arvato-systems.de?

This morning we suddenly can’t reach Telestream’s cloud service from Vantage software.

Hi Telestream,

 

We received a production alert today regarding our cloud flip workflow. It appears that the cloud flip in Flip64 action started to fail today morning at 9 AM EST.


 Error message: An error occurred calling FinishUpload : Error calling FinishUpload: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.

  !image-2021-11-08-15-48-42-945.png!

When I log in to the Telestream cloud dashboard, a warning message says TLS1.0/TLS1.1 is no longer supported. However, everything was fine until today, and the first error started at 9:44 AM EST from our side.

*Is this error related to the depreciation of TLS1.0/TLS1.1?*

  !image-2021-11-08-15-48-48-601.png!

Here are some security protocol related settings from our vantage server, please let us know if we need to change anything to resolve this error.

Hi Mike,

 

I set the TLS 1.2 Enabled value to 1, then restarted the service from both Windows Services and Vantage console. The error is still there when I’m trying to restart the job. So It looks like the registry value isn’t the key factor here. Again, everything was working fine until this morning. Our records indicate that the last successful cloud flip conversion was today at 06:32 AM EST. Is the cutover for TLS 1.2 today from the Telestream side? And is there any method to check the connectivity from the server to cloud-flip’s service endpoint?

 

Thanks!

Charlie

    Sorry for the lack of the detail. You do not need to restart Windows. You will need to restart the ‘Vantage Telestream Cloud Service’ from the Windows Services control panel after making the change.

Hi Vanessa,

 

Who can help us in fixing this registry setting directly.  It’s a Blocker in Prod.

 

Hi Mike

 

As Registry change do not always require restart.  Is it the same case or a restart is required?

Mandar,

  Vantage relies on the Windows OS for available protocols. I believe you will need to modify the registry setting directly. The following screenshot is the same location from my test system as an example.

Hi Mike,

 

Do you want us to change setting on Windows level or there any setting on Vantage App level and force vantage flip action to use TLS 1.2 version?

 

I will prefer option 2; Setting on Vantage App level and force vantage flip action to use TLS 1.2 version over Windows level setting

 

Please enlighten us if such setting exist.

 

Windows OS Level Setting.

Charlie,

  The value of the TLS 1.2 registry setting looks suspect. I believe supported values for the “Enabled” key are 0 (disabled) and 1 (enabled). In this case the TLS 1.2 Client key should have the Enabled value data set to 1.

 

Thanks,

Charlie,

  Thanks for running the test. I don’t think I’m going to have any further updates on my end today. Since I can integrate my Vantage system with your Telestream Cloud account successfully in leads me to believe there is something environmental causing the problem.  

 

I will let you know when I hear back from Engineering.

 

Thanks,

Hi Mike,

 

We have a simple test workflow with just the cloud flip action uploading to the ‘Dev test’ store. I manually submitted a conversion with the same source asset, and it failed again with the same error message.

 

Thanks!

Charlie,

  I’m still waiting for further direction on my end. If you are interested in running another test I think it would be useful to test a separate simplified workflow. I don’t think anything on the API submission side would introduce this type of problem but it would be good to rule that out.

 

You would basically setup a new simplified workflow with just a Receive action to Flip64. Configure the Flip64 action with the same Cloud Mode settings. Manually submit a file from the same source location and see if the action stalls or completes.

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

Hi All,

  As discussed on the last call I reached out to Engineering for assistance and raised awareness regarding the severity of the problem. I received a quick response and direction. As a next step I need to integrate my Vantage test system with the Sony Telestream Cloud account and run a test. Is it OK if I run this test using the ‘Dev Test’ store. I will label the file clearly but want to make sure this is OK before attempting to run a job with your TSC account and S3 bucket.

 

Thanks,


 Mike

Charlie,

  I tested again after importing your registry settings and did not have any problems. I think the Flip64 action may still be attempting to use the old access keys instead of getting the new keys that you updated in Telestream Cloud. Can you try disabling Cloud Mode for the Flip64 action and then enabling it again? I’m happy to join a remote session as well.

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

Hi Vanessa,

I checked with our cloud-ops team, and there’s no change from their side as well. The conversion software Vantage will initiate a service call to Telestream’s cloud flip endpoint for this cloud feature, so the Vantage machine is the source. And this feature was working, until yesterday morning.

 

Thanks!

Charlie

Hi Charlie,

Have you checked on the Sony side to see if any network/firewall changes have been made?

 

Is this vantage machine the source or destination? Does it have to communicate with another machine to process the ‘cloud flip’?

 

Thanks,

Hi Vanessa,

I just want to confirm. So recently, there’s no firewall change or system patches (which will affect network protocol/ports) have been done for this machine (gtsmewve07805.server.arvato-systems.de), right?

 

Thanks!

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for providing the diagnostic tool!

 

I don’t think it’s the TLS version issue because, in both Prod and Dev servers, we have changed the TLS registry value to what was suggested by Telestream and restarted both services and server. And still the following retry of the failed job wasn’t successful.

 

However, I’ve run the diagnostic utility in our Dev environment and collected the output.

Please find the attached txt file. And let me know if you need anything else from my side.

 

Thanks!

Charlie

Charlie,

  I’m following up regarding the diagnostic utility that I mentioned. The following Aspera link contains the utility. It is a small executable that will report back available TLS protocol and related info in a cmd window. Running the utility now would give us a compare point in the event the problem ever returned in the future.

 

To use it, you would:

 
 # Copy the zip to the machine where the Vantage Cloud Service is running
 # Extract the zip file (this will create a folder named:     Test_TLS_Connection
 # Go into this folder and double-click on the ConsoleApp15.exe   program

 

After clicking on the .exe program, you will see a CMD window popup and information will be dumped into the window. Copy the data returned to a txt file. Please send me a copy and also store for possible comparison in the future.

Hi Charlie,

  Great news the system is up and running again. I’m not aware of any changes on our end. Engineering created a utility to help diagnose the problem which would have been the next step in troubleshooting. I’m going to familiarize myself with the utility now. This may be worth running on your operational system as well to collect more info. I will follow after I explore the utility.

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

Hi Mike,

 

Did anything change from your engineering team? Can you provide us with the root cause analysis? 

There’s nothing changed from Sony Music side, and this morning cloud-flip started working.

 

Thanks for your time!

Charlie

Have there been any changes made during an AOMA patch build or to engineer permissions? Yesterday the profile was there although there wasn’t a CT number, see below:

It may not be as relevant but just to ensure the source cover asset (master [000007505741|https://aoma.smcdp-de.net/servlet/com.sonymusic.aoma.AOMADispatcherServlet?chain=MasterSearchDetailDisplayAction&masterID=7505741]) is okay from asset standpoint, I tried quick converting it to jpeg and png format (the request went through Arvato instance of MC) and received the output in both jpeg and png format.

So seems like an issue with processing Pseudo Videos.. Shreyas can coordinate with Brajesh to get any info he needs to investigate further.

Thanks,

Rohit 

 

 ;;;","02/Aug/21 3:42 PM;bsahoo1;No [~GULE001], Videos are still getting registered via jar.

[~KAMT001], I have copied the requested files to your My AOMA Files > migration.;;;","05/Aug/21 5:50 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

 

[~bsahoo1] provided me with the assets used in the above conversion. I tried locally the conversion for the above error.

Request Id : 217704263

The conversion fails when ImageMagick tries to create the resized-image from the provided TIFF file. The next step of the conversion fails as the application is not able to find the resized-image.png. The is probably because the TIFF file is multi-layered and hence ImageMagick creates a different png file for each layer image. Hence I can see multiple images being created after the intermedia conversion step.

 

!image-2021-08-05-21-17-26-033.png|width=483,height=133!

Please let me know if we can assign this to Jackie in the GMP team to take a look into this. Also attached the tiff file used.

Thanks.;;;","19/May/21 1:41 AM;kamt001;Hi [~bsahoo1],

 

The issue is with the end parameter passed which is 265.232. And the total duration of the file is 265.231633. Hence the end seconds clipping point is out of the bounds of the total file duration. That is why Media Conversion application is throwing this error. Please correct the end seconds parameter to be passed as 265.231 which will result in successful conversion.

Please refer DPSA-26038

The end seconds parameter passed in this case is 256.76. The start seconds is 2.88. The total file duration is 256.56. The clip end seconds is going beyond the total duration of the file. Hence the application has a validation and throwing an error for the same.

Ajay Akiti;;;","21/Apr/21 5:10 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

 

I got the source asset and did some analysis. It seems like the file is not an actual wav file. Following is the media info of the file : -

!image-2021-04-21-11-04-50-239.png|width=592,height=398!

The actual info for a WAV file should be like below : -

!image-2021-04-21-11-06-00-723.png|width=579,height=291!

The format of the file should be a WAV file whereas it is MPEG Audio for the original file.

Media Conversion uses Java's AudioSystem package for removing the headers from the Wav files. As the format of the file is incorrect the error message is been thrown as ""File of unsupported format""

Looking into this.

Thanks

I reached out to mlib team about the missing previews and the conversion requests they are sending for these previews are receiving errors in regards to the input file be used. Can you review the file registered here to make sure everything looks good?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","22/Feb/21 9:49 PM;coop002;Taking a look at the file I uploaded & looping in Rick Haylock as well. Everything looked fine to me in terms of metadata in AOMA & file metadata, but will loop back shortly if we see anything off. 

Thanks! ;;;","22/Feb/21 11:47 PM;rhayloc;I tried a quickconvert from the product page- nothing came out.  The asset is MVD_000016121888_FILE_DGTL can this be confirmed it is on the DPL? Can we force a re-gen of previous to happen? I don't fond anything that is wrong with Zach's asset but maybe FFMPEG doesn't like something about it.

 ;;;","23/Feb/21 6:03 PM;coop002;So I tried to unregister & re-register with a different MSA asset, still no previews but a successful registration. Then I tried a master only reg that I was hoping I could link to the product number and still a successful registration but no previews. Any idea of what to try next? I'm rather stumped. 

I attempted a manual export of a 2086 and got an error (attached) Maybe this can shine some light on what's going on? ;;;","23/Feb/21 6:14 PM;spag001;Hey Zach,

Let me reach out to conversion team on the error being thrown here to see if we can get a better sense of what's going on with the file.

Hi conversion team,

Were getting the the attached error with this master when attempting to create some of its mlib previews and when Zach attempted to export with CT 2086. Can you check what seems to be causing this error to be thrown?

Conversion request for the export:
RequestCd - AOMAEXPORT_676531_9728700_64132542_2086
Request_Id - 215191157

Thanks

Matthew;;;","23/Feb/21 6:20 PM;coop002;Perfect thanks! 

Since I unregistered & re-registered the asset this morning the master & job ID changed from this screenshot which was taken last night.

New Master: 16121888
New Job ID: 1846630 

;;;","23/Feb/21 7:04 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

 

I downloaded the asset and tried the conversion locally using FFMpeg. It seems that FFMpeg is throwing errors for some invalid headers.

 

!image-2021-02-23-13-02-09-992.png|width=368,height=191!

 

This is the reason why Media Conversion is throwing an error.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Shreyas Kamthe;;;","23/Feb/21 7:07 PM;spag001;Gotcha, thanks Shreyas!

Hey Zach,

As Shreyas mentioned the issue stems from invalid headers.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","23/Feb/21 11:58 PM;coop002;Hi all,

I converted the original source to uncompressed 8bit and back to pro res LT, it unearthed a deadpixel that wasn't showing in the prores version, a new source was delivered and it successfully registered and generated previews.

I got the input files and tried the conversion on my local machine. The issue seems to be with the image that is a multi layered. 

Because of this Image Magick is creating multiple images and appending -0, -1 ... -n to the generated images and hence the application is not able to find the actual image.

!image-2021-01-08-12-06-11-595.png|width=566,height=143!

I found following links that give us idea about the issue.

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14556984/imagemagick-creating-multiple-files]
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16179838/imagemagick-convert-tiff-warnings-multiple-output-files-created]

For the conversion to be successful the image should be single layered.

Could you check out the conversion request. Looks to be some issue copying files. I should be able to grab the file used here if needed.

Can you provide me the mov file that is being used in this conversion ?

I have copied the file over to your migration folder in production.



Matthew;;;","22/Jan/21 8:08 PM;kamt001;Hi [~SPAG001],

 

The issue is with the parameter that is being passed in the request. Below is the command that was run to generate the target file.

 

c:\Program Files\ffmpeg-20170312-58f0bbc-win64-static\bin\ffmpeg.exe -i MVD_000016033528_001.mov -vframes 1 -q:v 0 -vf yadif,crop=(iw-0-0):(ih-0-0):0:0,scale=1920:1080,setsar=1/1 *-ss 252.2* -t 1.0 -metadata title=Neujahrsgruß / New Year's Address / Allocution du Nouvel An -metadata author=Wiener Philharmoniker, Riccardo Muti, Riccardo Muti & Wiener Philharmoniker temp0.jpg

If you look in the command there is a start seconds (ss) which is being passed as 252 seconds. But the total length of the file is 229 seconds (3 mins and 49 seonds). So either the whole file is not uploaded correctly or else the input parameter to get the VIC image from the video is being passed wrong.

I tried the above conversion with -ss 200 and it worked fine for me.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Shreyas Kamthe;;;","22/Jan/21 9:00 PM;spag001;Thanks Shreyas.

Hi all,

Looks like the wrong timecode is being used for this video as the timecode is longer then the video's length. Updating the timecode to the appropriate value will allow the registration to go through. (Current timecode - 252199 milliseconds  => 4.20 minutes)

 # Divide by zero error being thrown by Vantage MPEG-2 workflow 
\\ \\
RCA provided in this ticket by Matthew Woo:  WPTS-259378 - Vantage - CT12193 - Export Jobs Stuck in ""Packaging In Process""
\\ \\
Same conclusion drawn by analysis here:  WPTS-259385 - Vantage - DEV - CT12192 and CT12193 failure errors
\\ \\
They both point to a product defect with Vantage 8 update pack 2, we have upgraded Vantage to update pack 3 and ""touching"" the Constuct action tile in the workflow designer. 
\\ \\
 # Export should not just get stuck, it should properly fail.  AOMA need to pull a more recent MC jar file for this fix (targeted for 10/26 AOMA release). The fix was rolled out as a part of ACS-1438 - Vantage conversions are failing in production with ""Export Stuck"". ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brajesh;;;","06/Oct/20 5:53 PM;gule001;Sharada, Shreyas and myself looked at this issue extensively this morning. 

Shreyas will be creating a unit test to reproduce this locally. 

There  were 121 successful conversions of this type completed since 4/28 but 9 recently failed. 

{code:sql}
select count(*), sl.status_level_nm , 
min(ca.date_inserted), max(ca.date_inserted) 
from conversion_archive.conversions c
join conversion_archive.conversion_assets ca on ca.conversion_asset_id = c.conversion_asset_id
join status_levels sl on sl.status_level_id = ca.status_level_id
where c.conversion_type_id = 12 
group by sl.status_level_nm
{code}

It seems to indicate an issue with this conversion working properly with this specific asset. 

To rule out the issue being a transient one, can you please retry the conversion. 

Until Shreyas completes the unit test, there is no further analysis that can be provided.  ;;;","06/Oct/20 6:30 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

I have copied over the contents of master 15545233 to your migration folder in production. Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks
Matthew;;;","06/Oct/20 9:19 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

 

I got the media files from [~SPAG001] and tried the conversion locally. The conversion went fine for me. All the target assets were created successfully.

Also in the prod error that we got, the application was complaining about the file temp0.ddp2ddp.1.3 which is the final target source that gets generated. This file is pretty large and hence there may be some glitch in the system that has caused the conversion to fail.

Please let us know if resetting the conversion has succeeded.

 

Thanks and Regards,

The WIP GTLSDAPROD00050 which picked up the above job ""1721322"" was running out of space. I have cleaned up some disk space. Would you be able to re-submit this registration job? I am also trying to see, apart from the insufficient space issue is there anything else that could fail this conversion. 

Please note, the failure happened during the descriptor generation phase while outputting the XML descriptor of the uploaded PDF booklet.

;;;","29/Sep/20 9:47 PM;sdonipu;+UPDATE+:

Appears to be that the ImageMagick tool (identify.exe command) is somehow not able to access the PDF file located at {color:#403294}""/SDA/aoma-ifs-nas-prod-int-01/prod-aoma/master/pkgf/0005/GFX_000015494106/PRESS-READY/000015494106_BK_PS_01_01_01.pdf""{color} and this behavior occurs with any other booklets at the same location. WIP-GTLSDAPROD0033 which picked up the resubmitted job has sufficient space now. So it is not an insufficient space problem.

Seems to be a file access permission issue. I have manually run the command-line against the same file and got ""Access is Denied"" as a response. Continuing investigation and will keep everyone posted.

This is a known problem with 2085 (inclusive of 22085/32085) and 2084 (inclusive of 22084/32084) because these 2 conversion profiles are the first set of FFMPeg CT batch which are currently using the old scaling logic. We have not updated them to the revised scaling logic as there was a decision pending from GMP side which of the below option(s) to go forward with:

1. Upgrade these 2 profiles to the newer version of computing output dimensions like others.
2. Replace them with the 3006 YT profile. If I remember correctly, we discussed in one of our conversion meetings, using 3006 instead of 2085 for bucketing logic.

Please advise and confirm how to proceed. We will have these 2 profiles fixed based on your feedback and suggestion.

Thanks,
Sharada;;;","03/Aug/20 7:06 PM;rhayloc;Hi Sharada,

Yes, I recall some of the history here.. I thought that while we did not high prioritize the fixes to preserve 2085/ 2084, they were approved to get fixed at some point.. That is my recollection from a conversion meeting long ago.  3006 already replaces these for YT, but we did not retire these because there is no other CTs that do exactly that these do- preserve 2k, 4k at either matted sizes or clean cropped in-place.  So we wanted to keep these, just wasn't priority to fix since neither are assigned to partner.

I did not see any issue with 2084 when I compared and I see this ticket that seems to show where things left off- 2084 was checked but 2085 never got followed up on:  https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/ACS-1061    I also see other tickets opened to update ffmpeg ver related to 2085... So yes, please proceed with updating any ffmpeg CTs that are in need so they all using the approved, up to date logics and tables (option 1 above).  Thank you.

Was running some tests on this in stage env and could reproduce with the file. It looks like the issue lies with the ghostscript command used for the copy conversion which creates the preview specifically used for this previews generation. Thanks Shreyas for the huge help in looking into this!

Hi Media Conversion team,

Can you analyze the attached ghostscript command to see what could be causing the text being cleared out in the previews? (I have attached the command, along with the json for the conversion request) Here is the information associated with the stage job I reproduced the issue with.

I checked the logs for this conversion. The error is thrown while generating the .mov file using the conversion type 2067. But the issue most probably lies in the conversion done to convert the .trk file to .wav file. During this conversion, there are two parameters being passed as :-

00:00:00:00

00:00:01:10

These variants decide the start of the silence wav to be appended to the wav file. I changed the parameters a little bit from 00:00:01:10 to 00:00:01:11 and 00:00:01:09 and in both the cases the conversion was successful generating the final .mov file. 

My best guess is that because of this particular time duration, the framerate gets distorted while padding the given input source.

Is this something that can be changed from your side ?

 

Thanks and Regards,

This particular video registration is picked by one of the WIPs - GTLSDAPROD0100 which is undergoing maintenance currently. There was an insufficient disk space issue reported recently with Arvato PROD VMs where we had to request Arvato DC to patch these VMs with additional disk space. The last batch of VMs was scheduled to patch today.  I will let you know once the patching activity is completed. In case, If the registration job fails even after 3 re-tries then, we might need your help to re-submit the failed job. Please let me know if that's okay.

Hi Jamie,

It could just be how the CT is configured which may not have any file extension specified.

 

As long as adding the mp3 extension works fine, we should be good.

 

Hi Reid,

Can you please check the extension of CT20122 in Arvato specific db.

Thanks,

Rohit

Hey Rohit. I’m trying to do some conversions of watermarked files for Russia. I’m using Media File Converter for the watermarked wav file to the CT for each partner (listed below). All of the output files, other than the mp3’s for UMA came out with the extension .null. Is there a reason that these CT’s convert this way?

Hi all,

I spoke to Jamie.

 

If any of the below CTs are copy conversions, they will deliver flac file via digital supply chain feed (since delivery stores audio sources in flac format). However, when used on AOMA MFC tool, the same copy conversion will output Wav as the source is a wav.

 

Ted, Shreyas

If you can let me know what each of these CTs are, I can suggest which CT Jamie should be using via MFC tool. E.g. for all copy conversions, Jamie should use CT 30016 in MFC which will output flac file

 
 # iTunes (ITN)  // CT 11023
 # Spotify (SPO) // CT 11023
 # UMA (UMA) // CT 20122
 # Amazon Music (AM3) // CT 11023
 # Deezer (DZR) // CT 11023
 # YouTube Music (YTC) // CT 11023
 # Yandex (YAN) // CT 21023
 # Tidal (ASP) // CT 21023
 # TikTok (TIK) // CT 21023

Happy to jump on a call.

 

Thanks,

Rohit;;;","21/Oct/20 11:37 PM;kamt001;Hi [~roraj01],

 

Please find the details of the Conversion Types as follows :-

 

21023 : Conversion SHELF Full Length - Flac, 16Bit, Interleave Stereo, Linear PCM

11023 : File Copy (16Bit Audio FLAC)

Hi Jamie,

20122 is an mp3 conversion so using it via MFC is fine. Just name it .mp3 if the output comes as .null.

 

The CT 21023 is also a copy conversion, so please use 30016 for this too.

Could you verify these are processing now? (Might be catching up to these jobs from backlog)

Following conversions failed for below errors from Vantage server. Are those legitimate failures?

Let us know if you need any further information.

what CT is this for? construct error sounds like it belongs to MPEG 12193.

The error ""Unable to evaluate the mathematical expression ""(0*Infinity) /2"" The expression may not be valid"" doesn't sound like a normal process error, but like it was given a non-numerical value.

what are the product numbers?

 # Divide by zero error being thrown by Vantage MPEG-2 workflow 
\\ \\
RCA provided in this ticket by Matthew Woo:  WPTS-259378 - Vantage - CT12193 - Export Jobs Stuck in ""Packaging In Process""

Same conclusion drawn by analysis here:  WPTS-259385 - Vantage - DEV - CT12192 and CT12193 failure errors
\\ \\
They both point to a product defect with Vantage 8 update pack 2, we have upgraded Vantage to update pack 3 and ""touching"" the Constuct action tile in the workflow designer. 
\\ \\
 # Export should not just get stuck, it should properly fail.  AOMA need to pull a more recent MC jar file for this fix (targeted for 10/26 AOMA release). The fix was rolled out as a part of ACS-1438 - Vantage conversions are failing in production with ""Export Stuck"". ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks.;;;","07/Aug/20 3:32 PM;gule001;[~bsahoo1] - Media Conversion team worked with [~SAMA030] to get to the bottom of this issue and had to put 2 fixes in. 

# Vantage wrapper fix to pass 0s for clip start and end point to Vantage workflows when full video extract is requested. 
# Workflow fix to make sure two simultaneously requested extracts of the same video do not result in 2 vantage jobs stepping on each other by using the same temp filename. 

Both fixes need to be promoted to production, but we are waiting for a green light from AOMA testers that it's a go. 

Thanks,

Promo export for above completed, and contains 7 files as expected, with correct file names etc:
!image-2020-08-07-14-02-20-605.png!;;;","10/Aug/20 5:01 PM;jpitzer;Greetings,

I've done a regression test using G010003203877V and CT3006.

Selected all 7 clips, and after successful conversion/export, I have 8 files. The additional clip name is TotalVideo.

So it looks like the extra clip issue for a converted export is likely on the AOMA side.

Thanks
Matthew;;;","29/Oct/20 1:12 AM;kamt001;Hey Matt,

 

I tried the conversion on my local machine using the ffmpeg tool directly. That is, without Media Conversion. Still I am getting the cracking sound in the background that you mentioned. Also I tried using a newer version of ffmpeg and still the sound exists.

The sound most probably exists in the source asset also, but because of the high quality of source and a different format (.mov), the sound may not be that clear in the source asset. Media Conversion is using the following command for CT3006 :-

 

ffmpeg.exe -i <input_file.mov> -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -b:v 40M -profile:v high422 -level 5.2 -ar 48000 -ab 384k -vf yadif=0:-1:1,crop=(iw-0-0):(ih-0-0):0:0,scale=1920:1080,setsar=1/1 <output_file.MP4>

I am also posting the logs that were posted by ffmpeg while doing the conversion if Rick or Mike can find something out of it :-

Shreyas Kamthe;;;","02/Nov/20 10:51 AM;axten01;Thanks for this. What do I need to do now? If the product goes out on youtube / apple music etc - and its converted (depending on customers preferential settings - youtube etc.) - then this sound is going to show up, right? 

Should I source a new audio with this problem corrected? 


The video launches on Friday NOV 6 !!!


Thanks,

Could you assist with Penny's query?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","02/Nov/20 4:34 PM;mcatande;We can attempt to replace the audio with a master in AOMA if this is how the rep owner wants to proceed.  We suspect the distortion could be a result of the audio being near peak. The conversion to aac in the encoding process could be what's leading to the click/distortion sounds.  

Please advise if this audio is available in AOMA.  Provided there is no difference in the edit, we should be able to do this.  ;;;","02/Nov/20 4:47 PM;axten01;Alas there was an edit from the mastered audio single. The video is substantially shorter, so we cant replace with the AOMA single audio. 

Can you bring down the audio levels of the original, so they are NOT so close to peak?  WOuld this then solve the issue currently being encountered after aac conversion? 

 

thanks!
Penny

RCA provided in this ticket by Matthew Woo:  WPTS-259378 - Vantage - CT12193 - Export Jobs Stuck in ""Packaging In Process""
\\ \\
Same conclusion drawn by analysis here:  WPTS-259385 - Vantage - DEV - CT12192 and CT12193 failure errors
\\ \\
They both point to a product defect with Vantage 8 update pack 2, we have upgraded Vantage to update pack 3 and ""touching"" the Constuct action tile in the workflow designer.

 # Export should not just get stuck, it should properly fail.  AOMA need to pull a more recent MC jar file for this fix (targeted for 10/26 AOMA release).

Keith;;;","29/Sep/20 4:54 PM;kamt001;Hi [~kmccar1],

 

I checked the conversion this morning and can see that the conversions are still going on. As I mentioned before there are a lot of pdf files clubbed in one single conversion. Hence, the conversion is taking a lot of time.

 

Thanks and Regards,

The issue is occurring because of some known security issue in the Arvato Prod servers. I have restarted the service and I can now see that the conversion is completed. 

We are working with the Info Sec team for resolving the security issue.

Please let me know if the conversion is as expected.

Matthew;;;","23/Jun/20 6:38 PM;kamt001;Hi Team,

I checked the database for the details of CT32001. The record is present in the Conversion_type_list table. But the metadata details are not present for this conversion_type in the metadata table. The query that tries to get the information of the CT also tries to look in the metadata table and is not getting anything. Hence the exception is being thrown.

I will put in the required details in the metadata table for this conversion type.

The conversions were not failed at the Media Conversion side. The conversions were shown as they were still in the queue or sent to some WIP. But after that there was no trace of the further process of the conversion. Also the logs of the WIPs where these conversions were sent had not trace of the Asset_Id tagged to these conversions.

Brajesh;;;","07/Jul/20 1:23 AM;kamt001;Hi,

I tried one of the conversions from the list using CT11079 in the Prod Environment using the MFC tool. I was able to do the conversion successfully but the file that I got downloaded was a corrupt and somewhat related to DPSA-25092 and DPSA-25095. 

Also I tried the CT11079 conversion using a different file and the conversion was successful. Also the file was not corrrupt in this case.

For the above conversions I checked the Rhozet logs and the logs say that the conversion was successful as in there were not errors in the logs.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Shreyas Kamthe;;;","23/Jul/20 9:42 PM;sama030;Hi Keith,

Could you please inform the user that CT11079 was using an old software that was causing many issues during its end of life. A new CT (CT12192) is in progress to be rolled out in 1 week that should resolve any issues.

 

In the meantime, the user can use the source export (Full clip rather than program only) or reach out to GMP if the program only is needed prior to next week.

 

Thanks,

Thanks,

Keith;;;","30/Jul/20 6:10 PM;gule001;For the record, the RCA on this is there is a historical product defect with the Rhozet platform which periodically due to unknown causes makes Rhozet unstable.  While we don't have a long term fix, or a further RCA on it, the short term fix is to restart the Rhozet servers.  As Rhozet is going to be turned off within the month, we will not be investigating this further. ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can you please check these new exports (on the 8th)? Benjamin Chapron - chap008 has said that the system resent the old purged files rather than the newly registered PDFs.

yes the issue is that the exports from the 8{^}th{^} were good on my preview and on my side, so I send them again to the factory but when I sent them (I did it 3 times), they received the ones from the 2{^}nd{^} still

Thank you, Benoit and Benjamin,
 
We’ve checked 19802974622. We see the original PKGX registration of 000027419111 and export to CES was on September 2nd. Then the master was purged, re-registered, and exported to CES again on the 8th. Are the exports to CES on the 8th the issue? If possible, please share any additional information to help with troubleshooting.

Dear AOMA Support Team,
 
We would like to report some issues we have been experiencing with AOMA over the past two or three days.
For example, we attempted to export the latest version of the packaging rassets for reference number 198029974622, but our recipient received the previous version.
 
Thank you for your help

This has to be exported to the plant tonight. It seems like the AOMA Generated CD Text option is failing when selected for export. When I try Native CD Text, I'm able to export successfully. The DDP needs to be exported with the AOMA Generated CD Text, as per usual RCA workflow.

The Enhanced Track 2000000866171/01 ""Institutional Video"" have Third Party as repertoire owner. We need no ISRC for Third Party tracks.

The product 51198420200 is linked as local number on the product 5119842. France and the Netherlands use the number 51198420200. Both products/track listings are indentically.   

Maybe Luis can check the master for the product 5119842. If the master 51198420200 makes trouble then France or the Netherlands should send a master or check there track listing.  

Best regards
Michael

Hi Fiona,

 

I’d like to highlight another issue we’re facing with MBC downloads. After the recent update to my account and others (as requested earlier) to enable downloading of pre-release and post-release content, we initiated a couple of new batches to download certain files.

 

While the folders are being successfully created on Sony Ci, the videos themselves are not appearing even after waiting for more than half a day. Can you please look into this and check what might still be restricting the downloads?

Dear Support,

 

I tried to upload a digital booklet for G0100054854355 and now AOMA is indicating a validation error. I have tried to scroll over or check otherwise but cannot find the Error Details on this page? There was also no notification send.

 

Could you please advise where I can find the details in order to revise the file?

 

Thank you,

Yes I am using a Mac and Firefox. Others have experienced the same issue. If you have logged out a of AOMA and click a UST link in a Jira ticket it will open UST with the most recent product information you had opened instead of opening to the product UST url you click on. I can try and do a screen record to show you, if that helps?;;;","12/Aug/25 8:13 PM;kmccar1;Hi team,

I was able to recreate this once, but didn't manage to record. I think it has more to do with AOMA going back to the same UI / page that was open at the time of log-out. For example, I'll leave the Registration Job Status UI as my AOMA ""open tab,"" and close down the browser for the day. When I restart my browser and login the next day, Registration Job Status will load instead of the home page. I imagine something similar is happening here.

This master already has a virtual association for track 1 which is why its getting blocked out. We should either be removing that virtual master or updating the track instead. I will talk with the team on enhancing the messaging here though.

Looks like everything is linked here, but the virtual track master should have either been removed and replaced with a complete master, or the additional tracks should have been downloaded, downconverted under a master only, and the virtual master link updated. Now we have an ugly 1 track 16bit WAV virtual master, and a partial full master missing track 1. The whole thing would need to be unpublished and re-linked properly to fix.

I'm sorry but I see no change here. All of these master IDs are still present in the system. We want to delete the master IDs, so that if I put the id in the Archive Submission tool, nothing comes up (because the IDs are gone). Sort of like our Delete / Reset Master ID function in A2.

I suppose when you select ID Type: Master and ID Master, then pressing on search icon you getting response from system DB not from the elasticsearch storage. 
If you will try to search these masters via Search 2.0 or AMP Search, you won't get response. 
Please check.

Thank you;;;","03/Sep/25 3:23 PM;kmccar1;Understood - that's right, there's no search results but what we're looking for is master ID deletion. Will run it by Rohit and team later today.

Keith;;;","03/Sep/25 3:50 PM;pala017;Crosschecked the DB for the masters listed, its soft deleted already but able to load in DA system.

[~wang042] - Please create a fix ticket that only active master should load in DA.  This should be an enhancement/existing bug.

Alem;;;","29/Aug/25 8:31 PM;prag008;Hi [~zeki001] ,

As discussed, the issue is not related to the product import itself, but rather to specific import attempts linked to registration. These attempts are currently in a ""Waiting for RAAS"" status, which is causing the registration process to stall. We will coordinate with the relevant team to review and update the status of these imports to either ""Success"" or ""Failure"" accordingly.

Please also share the estimated time of completion as soon as it becomes available.

Regards,

When performing ""fetch masters"" via A3 product linking / link edit for the Atmos master associated to {color:#000000}G010005643316E{color} the system is returning many results that do not have the correct ISRC . 

In this instance the user did not check the default result and the wrong track ended up being linked. I have since gone in and edited to be correct however, the linking interface seems to not be working correctly. 

Could you please advise the issue and whether it can be fixed?

Screenshot shows all results returned for track 3 on G010005643316E, the second result on the list should be the only one that the system returns as valid. ",,bsahoo1,burg036,deve003,hale002,kmccar1,kori002,kuma011,kuma039,kyry001,lemo022,mcatande,niko001,pala017,rbarry1,roraj01,spag001,stef003,venu001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"29/Aug/25 5:13 PM;lemo022;Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 15.28.26.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2661847/Screenshot+2025-08-29+at+15.28.26.png","29/Aug/25 5:25 PM;lemo022;Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 16.25.11.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2661872/Screenshot+2025-08-29+at+16.25.11.png","01/Sep/25 11:16 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-16-30-571.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662520/image-2025-09-01-11-16-30-571.png","01/Sep/25 11:16 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-16-40-439.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662521/image-2025-09-01-11-16-40-439.png","01/Sep/25 11:21 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-21-36-696.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662527/image-2025-09-01-11-21-36-696.png","01/Sep/25 11:21 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-21-54-840.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662528/image-2025-09-01-11-21-54-840.png","01/Sep/25 11:24 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-24-22-278.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662538/image-2025-09-01-11-24-22-278.png","01/Sep/25 11:29 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-29-56-901.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662543/image-2025-09-01-11-29-56-901.png","01/Sep/25 11:38 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-38-16-613.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662554/image-2025-09-01-11-38-16-613.png","01/Sep/25 11:43 AM;burg036;image-2025-09-01-11-43-37-461.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2662556/image-2025-09-01-11-43-37-461.png",,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3p9o7:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lemo022,,No,,,,,,,"29/Aug/25 5:11 PM;deve003;[~lemo022] ,

This master 23406523 is an old master that was once associated to G010005643316E. The link was broken and the tracks were pulled, and re-registered in a different order to reflect a label copy change. This master should have been purged at the time.

Hi Carla, it looks like there is a system issue with linking atmos to stereo, the linking interface is pulling a lot of incorrect tracks as possible links when it should only be finding tracks with the relevant ISRC (pic below). I’ve edited the link to be track 1 from master 23428546 - ITB002300344 - G010005014174E please check and confirm this is correct.

 

 

@Burgess, Fiona , EXT I’ll submit a DPSA shortly for the linking interface issue

Apologies if there is already a ticket for this specific TusD issue. We've had two users encounter this Failed to Upload error. We can confirm we encountered the same error when we tried from our side in Prod. In both instances, we were able to register without error via Aspera.

Note, we also tried to replicate in Stage: TusD worked correctly for the WAV but failed with the same error on the cover. The files are attached in the ZIP.

We removed the old cover master and then linked the new cover (registered master only) AOMA3/Linked via Full Master.;;;","02/Sep/25 3:07 PM;burg036;UST shows each stuck at 'Preview generation is in progress'.

Checking this out.;;;","02/Sep/25 6:16 PM;kuma011;Hi [~burg036],

Since the file names contain ""_B"", the MLIB is interpreting them as Back Covers and is not generating previews. As the Back Cover concept is no longer applicable, we’ll raise a ticket to have their code updated accordingly.

In the meantime, could you please rename the files to remove the ""_B"" segment and resubmit them? A simple rename and swap should work.

For example:
SRXX05391B00Z_B_A_1_000.jpg → SRXX05391B00Z_A_1_000.jpg
resize_ESXX03097B00Z_B_A_1_000.jpg → resize_ESXX03097B00Z_A_1_000.jpg
resize_VVXX01873B00Z_B_A_1_000.jpg → resize_VVXX01873B00Z_A_1_000.jpg

Let me know once the files have been updated, or if you still face any issues.

Regards,
Kiran.;;;","02/Sep/25 10:18 PM;kmccar1;AOMA named files asset swapped successfully, previews are available. Please advise SME Japan users to simplify their naming techniques - all of the extra underscores, letters, numbers, are unnecessary.

Looks like it may be instance of bad data.

This one is interesting. Looks like only one of 6 tracks were registered when Milena tried initially. I think the subsequent errors were a result of that one. I was able to download and upload via TusD without any issue from my end, with the name folder and file naming. 

Let me know if you'd like to check out the source files.

Thanks,

Tobin selected Full Master Side, using the TusD uploader with the downconvert to 16 Bit WAV master checked. We tried to recreate from our side using the files shared by Tobin at this link: [https://app.cimediacloud.com/r/rhKq7FFqpS2Z]. The downoncvert 16 Bit WAV master registered with 4 tracks only and the 24 Bit WAV master seems to have stalled. There was no ""Down Convert In Progress"" status displayed for the 24 Bit WAV from our side.

Keith;;;","08/Jul/25 7:52 PM;spag001;Hi all,

So this is actually a two-parter. The initial issue was due to a issue we are fixing in the linked ticket. There is a rare race condition with the downconvert logic on fresh uploads when jobs finish at the exact millisecond (shared db resource causing the issue).

The reason the status didn't change was actually a bug in the failure logic that I will be working on a fix for asap. Sorry for the inconvenience and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

We came across this issue with [~tier012] and [~norm007] during the week. It seems that if one uploads a file under one product number via UST / TusD, and then navigates to another product and tries to upload the same file, the upload stalls out (""Asset Upload In Progress"" / ""Uploading Asset to AMP S3""). Or, if a user registers an audio master, unlinks (say, for a metadata import update) and tries to register the same files, the upload stalls out. 

To recreate: 

Register an asset via TusD / UST (seems to occur with both audio and cover assets - check STAGE Registration Job Status for multiple examples from this afternoon 8/15/2025 kmccar1)

Users will experience this issue and send the assets to Support to check. As we are submitting for the first time from our end, the TusD upload(s) and registration job(s) will complete without issue. Similarly, users will also pass on the files to someone else in their department to try uploading - the job will complete successfully as it was their first upload attempt with those assets. A run through PROD Registration Job status (""Asset Upload In Progress"" status) will display a good amount of these, which we had chalked up to user side connection issues for quite some time. Seems like it is something system related. Could you please check this out next week, team? 

Please let me know if you need any further information.

For DDP product G010004877386W master ID 22293994  

The aoma display for both the product and master info pages shows the ISRC for tracks 3 and 4 as USQX92203777 and USQX92203778

But the ISRCs embedded in the DDP files are USQX92202263 and USQX92202264 (screenshots below) 

No isrc mismatch is displayed in aoma as the ISRCs on the master info page display differently to the DDP but match the product ID. 

It appears the issue is with the DDP but as the disc description editor functionality has been removed from aoma I'm unable to change the PQ of the DDP in aoma.

I believe the plan was to remove that UI, and when the DDPPQ / DDPPMS / DDPID need to be updated, the DDP should be pulled, manually updated, and re-registered.

I can now download the PQ and MS files without issue, thanks for fixing. 

Unfortunately, the master details page is still showing the product metadata ISRCs for these two tracks and not the ISRCs on the ddp (these are a mismatch with the label copy)

Yes, this is still an issue. The master tab is showing ISRCs which match label copy and not the DDP, which are different ISRCs and should be highlighted as a mismatch as documented in the notes below.

sound possible?

checking tonight....;;;","31/Jul/25 7:16 PM;mcarpent;OK. I think this is fixed.

Short story is that the python built-in method I used to check for channel counts semi-ironically falls over when it is passed a file of more than 4GB. The largest file I has tested previously was just over 2GB. Replaced the logic with ffprobe.

It should effectively allow a new selection overwriting/swapping with the existing empty master.""",,alcoc02,burg036,hauck03,kmccar1,mcatande,rbarry1,roraj01,sama030,sira001,spag001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-1182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30/Nov/22 8:48 PM;kmccar1;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/1554960/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i0xwtj:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,"30/Nov/22 4:33 PM;spag001;Hi all,

Looks like the files uploaded here did not match the video dimensions. You should be able to re-register these in UST after clicking X on the icon. Is the issue here that they want to be able to use AOMA3 interface to re-register instead?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","30/Nov/22 8:50 PM;kmccar1;Hey [~SPAG001] ,

I believe that's the idea - the error message leads the user to believe that they cannot edit the VSC via the AOMA3 details.

[~mcatande],

I just went thru the thread - please let me know if I'm misunderstanding? 

Thanks,

Keith

 ;;;","30/Nov/22 9:22 PM;mcatande;My guess is that the user went through the following process: 
 # attempted to upload a VSC for UST - the VSC failed due to the dimensions not matching properly.
 # Instead of fixing the dimensions and resubmitting via UST, they went to the Product details interface to use the VSC select tool. When this occurred they received the failure due to the empty master from the previous attempt.  

I think we can expect a user to attempt something like this again though it may be an edge case. 

Suggested fix. Allow an empty master to be swapped/replaced via details interface (I think it didn't work in this case because AOMA is bridging two system types UST and traditional arvato). ;;;","30/Nov/22 9:25 PM;kmccar1;That makes sense - I know I would go straight to the product details to work on the VSC from my end. Will pass this back to the team for review in that case...

Thanks,

Keith;;;","30/Nov/22 10:05 PM;spag001;Hey all,

I think from the call we had earlier the long term fix is AOMA3 using the same registration flow as UST but I know there is some stuff that needs to be taken care of before then. Let me dicuss with the team for a temporary solution to this bridging issue. 

In the meanwhile let me see if we can clear out these old jobs so they can be resubmitted in AOMA3 as well.

Thank you.;;;","05/Jun/25 5:51 PM;shar051;Hi [~mcatande] 

The issue happened because the post-registration service (which does the auto QC and approval) was down due to some db connection pool system errors and the registration service could not connect to this service. 

We are working on making this post registration workflow event based so in case if the service is down, it can pick up any events from queue when it is back up and running. These changes will go out with the June build.

We tried to recreate on a PC and Mac using the product number/master number: 27383894 from your screenshot and were able to download from our end. However, maybe we misunderstood or the issue with this particular product number has been resolved. Can you share additional information on the steps taken with example product numbers? If this issue is the same as [DPSA-31345], a fix will be implemented shortly.

When exporting the Proxy/Preview for Track 13, it is exporting the previous master, so the 5 and 16 object are incorrect. The source export is working as expected.

Matthew;;;","27/Aug/25 10:18 PM;spag001;Hi db team,

As a side note (dont think this should be impacting the export), it looks like the issue that popped up didn't correctly clear out the assetIds for those failed swaps that was caused by the data issue.

For me its showing the new files when I attempt this download. (See below screenshot). Your saying when you perform this download its still showing up the other assets that were previously registered?

The ""source"" option exports the wav masters. The Proxy/Previews are the MP4 conversions.

As part of our 360RA QC, we check these MP4 conversions to confirm they are correct. Normally I would use the AOMA 2 export to create these MP4s, but currently is not available.

My account was missing that permission for proxy download which is why I confused, sorry about that. My hunch is that the data issue that we resolved caused the previews to not regen correctly.

Based off the kafka logs it looks like the TUS upload did not transfer correctly. I've manually failed the stuck upload so the user can re-upload.

For better context for the upload issue just want to clarify if the user remember if the TUS spec completed successfully on the pop up?

Issue was a field from this mp4 file that could not be determined from the desc file generation that was not being correctly handled by the backend validation (Format profile was coming up as null). A fix for this issue has been pushed last night so this shouldn't pop up again. 

The file itself needs to be corrected regardless which can either be done manually or via the auto-correction process since it doesn't meet spec. Let us know if you have any questions.

Hi team,

 

Could someone please review the attached Aoma uploads? The registered users are members of my team, but none of them actually performed these uploads. They were submitted around 3AM, a time when no one on our team was working. We're trying to understand how these uploads occurred.

 

Thank you very much for checking!

 

Kind regards,

Joran

Hari;;;","27/Aug/25 4:28 PM;spag001;Hi [~cosi001],

Last night we pushed a fix for a bug that was causing some emails to get stuck, so these emails finally got unstuck and sent out. Nothing was modified with these, this was just the system unclogging these.

For full contexts our email logic for multi tracks uploads in UST has grouping logic where it tries to wait for all active uploads to be in a complete status before sending out the email. The was a certain status (canceled) upload was being treated as in progress when it should have been complete. That has been fixed so now this email was sent out since the canceled upload is no longer blocking the upload.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks

Fiona;;;","27/Aug/25 12:20 PM;poty002;Hi Team,
I've investigated the issue.
This is a {*}data integrity issue{*}. The table *{{mmb_packaging_metadata}}* is modeled as *One-to-One* with {*}{{packaging_masters}}{*}, but *two rows* exist for the same master, causing downstream logic to fail when a single record is expected.
 * *Product:* {{19802955941}}

 * *Master (packaging_masters.id):* {{27388326}}

 * *Problem:* two {{mmb_packaging_metadata}} rows reference the same {{{}packaging_master_id = 27388326{}}}.



Affected flow:
*Product → ProductLinks → Master (27388326) → PackagingMaster → MMBMetadata*
After {{{}DirectUploadMasterSelectionAction{}}}, we enter {{{}DirectUploadViewAction{}}}, which loads PackagingMaster → *MMBMetadata* and expects *exactly one* row. Because two rows exist, the view/logic fails (e.g., non-unique result, ambiguous selection, or assertion on 1–1 mapping).

Diagnosis SQL (examples)
select * from masters m inner join product_links pl on m.master_id = pl.master_id where pl.product_id = 10916723;
select * from packaging_masters pm inner join masters m on pm.master_id = m.master_id where m.master_id = 27388326;
select * from mmb_packaging_metadata mmb inner join packaging_masters pm on mmb.master_id = pm.master_id where pm.master_id = 27388326;

Proposed fix: Data cleanup (one-time)

I linked a ticket from November that touched upon the ""Further Problems"" section. Multiple ISRCs will be 'found' on the same product. That first number ends up being the total number of products utilized, and then the second number is the total ISRCs returned. 

I just put the first 100 ISRCs through and got ""Showing 82 out of 99 products."" 82 product utilized, 99 tracks found, one track missing. Definitely confusing.
 
*Product Number 88697998162*
*Description*
There are no supported master with ISRC USRC14904639.
USRC14904639 - Perry Como ""Some Enchanted Evening"" seems to be on many products in the system, and it's on the product noted there (side 1 / track 14), not sure why it's not being picked up. Something with the virtual master maybe? Also, why would it be coming from a Time Life compilation out of all the different available products either (Title: Lifetime of Romance: Some Enchanted Evening - and no, this one is not in my personal collection). 
 
Let me know if you need help gathering these up tonight, I mess around with the MBC all the time. The dev team can check into the Perry Como error next week. 
 
+[~HALE002] as an FYI...
 
Keith;;;","31/Jan/25 11:09 PM;kmccar1;[~HALE002], is there an official ""maximum"" number of ISRCs that we can enter? Maybe there should be a limit? 

It doesn't seem to be a problem with large amounts of products, but the large amount of ISRCs is tricky, I assume. It was always tough with the A2 Batch Offerings, of course.

Checking this one now.;;;","26/Aug/25 6:21 PM;kori002;Hi [~tobi017] 
We have this check in place where a Virtual 16 Bit master cannot be created when a Full 16 Bit master is present. This should have been same with the case of 24 Bit Virtual masters also but I see that it allowed Virtual 24 Bit master to be created when there is a 24 Bit full master. We will check why this was allowed in the first place.

But for now I would suggest to delete the 16 Bit Full master and create a Virtual 16 Bit Master with all the 16 tracks. Also I would encourage to do the same for 24 Bit masters also to have consistency. Let me know if you need any help or have any questions. ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. When a cover is CMYK the follow errors get listed:

Aspect Ratio - The Value for this attribute is not readable from the header data of the submitted file. It is recommended to resave the asset(s) in a recent version of Adobe Photoshop to apply the appropriate header data and try again. Alternatively you can proceed as-is with the possibility that the file could fail secondary validations.

Resolution/Dimensions - The Value for this attribute is not readable from the header data of the submitted file. It is recommended to resave the asset(s) in a recent version of Adobe Photoshop to apply the appropriate header data and try again. Alternatively you can proceed as-is with the possibility that the file could fail secondary validations.

The Colorspace of this asset does not meet compliance. The image must be RGB.

Yet I'm still getting the same error with the aspect ratio, resolution and bits per channel. Is there's something with the CMYK that's causes those prompts to show up? I've attached my image to the ticket. Just strange this it occurring with only CMYK images. ;;;","19/Aug/25 5:06 PM;spag001;Hi all,

As discussed on the Monday call verified that the CYMK files is failing if pre-flight is skipped. (SONY CI upload) It just failed due to the colorspace being invalid so the other information was being picked up. So likely the issue with the CYMK file is the info isnt on the header info (so pre-flight has issues grabbing it). 

Thanks

Matthew;;;","19/Aug/25 5:16 PM;mcatande;[~spag001] the CMYK files Jackie created in Photoshop and should almost assuredly have the appropriate header information.  We think the check is bugging out when it's CMYK and erroring out on something unrelated because it's CMYK?

Manu asked me if I knew why there were null ISRCs on this one - I asked around and it's really quite rare. Mostly it's when labels are trying to move quickly and are behind updating label copy. We definitely still need the ability to export regardless of ISRC status in cases like this.

Can you review this one?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","04/Aug/25 4:49 PM;mcatande;We are under the impression that AOMA generated CD text needs to be approved before export of said CD text is allowed.  In this case it was exported without approval.  The product Title was not correct in CD text and the disc was manufactured incorrectly ( a large run).  

If CD text was operating as we expected, it would have forced an approval and possibly caught the title error.  ;;;","06/Aug/25 10:44 AM;poty002;Hi [~mcatande] [~kmccar1] 
Based on our investigation, we’re currently only verifying that the CD Text was saved, not whether it was approved.
We’ve created a new task for this on our board and will prioritize it for the next release.

Thank you,
Igor;;;","06/Aug/25 4:39 PM;mcatande;[~poty002] - Yes, we know it was definitely saved.  A Media Production engineer updated the track data for CD text (titles/ISRC), however the product Title in CD text was inadvertently left as ""TBD LP4"" (something like that), it was exported to the plant with this error and 10k discs were run with the bad title. 

We are under the impression that CD text should not have been exportable if it wasn't approved.  In this case we know it wasn't approved, yet it was still exportable and was exported with the error.  

We just need to make sure that if it's not working as expected (approval required), we identify and correct it.  ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I submitted the attached list of video products (videobatchconvert_one.xls) via the Video Batch Request UI, along with the below noted Conversion IDs (screenshot-1). 

10745, 10751, 10762, 10775, 10864, 10889, 10954, 20775, 11060, 11082, 11084, 20135, 20136, 20137

Once submitted, the UI responded successfully, with the ""Please wait..."" message (screenshot-2). After a few moments, I navigated to the General -> My AOMA Files -> offerings -> mcatande_request folder in another browser tab. While waiting for that to load, I went back to the Video Batch Request UI, which refreshed and displayed the attached Proxy Error (screenshot-3). I was then logged out of the system (2-Factor login).

It seems like the conversions are processing as expected so far - I'm expecting 196 files in total (14 products by 14 conversion IDs), but could you please check into this issue and let me know if A. I did anything incorrectly on my end B. why the proxy error was thrown and C. why I was immediately logged out of the system as a result. 

Let me know if you need any further information to investigate.

Please filter out the conversion IDs: 10745, 10751, 10762, 10775, 10864, 10889, 10954, 20775  from VIDEO Conversion Profiles List. These are Graphic conversions and as per the current implementation of Video Batch Request Interface these graphic conversions are not supported is my guess. Besides, the error shown is also not relevant. The error message would have been in a user-readable and understandable format. Seems to me an existing behavior and a bug. 

@AOMA Core Business Analysts - Please look into this, discuss with [~roraj01] and create an AMSE or AOMA ticket depending on the nature of the fix (bug or enhancement).

The QC metadata page has the source format as ""AppleProResHD"". This value is retrieved from the product_master_source_types table.

The source format -""AppleProRes"" is displayed in the video detail page if the asset sub type is ""Apple ProRes Music Video"".
Please check if the name should be changed at one of this locations and if additional information is required. 

Regards,
Praveen;;;","17/Dec/18 5:55 PM;sala072;Hi Praveen,
We should surely change the naming convention so that they are consistent and do not confuse the user.

However the question is - should we display source format on video details page as the value that is retrieved from the product_master_source_types table OR change the asset sub type display.

Let me sync up with Rohit and get back to you.

Thanks,
Brittney

We will ensure that this video displays AppleProResHD as the video soruce type on the video details page.

Is there also a case where AppleProResSD is a valid soruce type? We want to make sure that we have all the bases covered.

Thanks,
Brittney

;;;","17/Dec/18 7:45 PM;mcatande;ProRes is a codec 
SD/HD is a resolution standard like 2K and 4K

The only way that this wouldn't have happened is if the duration was entered in at a later time - I don't believe this happened here though, as I'm not seeing any metadata import duration overrides between the registration date of June 12, and the ""Set Complete"" date of June 25.

Shouldn't the import have failed at this point, since the linked master 12900061 has a duration of 4:25, over a minute difference from the updated LC duration of 6:08?

4. 6/26 - Master 13045267 registered under 19075874622, and linked to digital equivalent G010003956043G. Track 3 on the master is 6:08, matching the current track label-copy. No warning messages at this point. Per Nathalie Vogel, there should be a warning if a track master exists in the system that has a duration discrepancy with another track master that is being uploaded under the same ISRC.

The ""Cover art"" or ""Back Cover"" master types should not be register-able to LFV. Technically only those assets which are permitted within an LFV package master should be register-able to an LFV configured product. 

On a separate Note France did indicate that they want to see their poster art in Digital Exchange (just like their audio cover art). I don't think this is working at the moment for them. ;;;","22/Sep/17 10:15 PM;roraj01;Hi Brittney,
This was not at all related to poster.

If you look carefully on the product linking screenshot, the system permitted a cover master link/registration to a LFV product which should not be allowed.

The project here is to prevent Cover master from being linked/registered to a LFV product. I think we already had a similar project to add this check for Short form video products.

Hi Mike,
We have a separate ticket to add support for LFV poster previews in DX. We didn't get a chance to work on details of it as yet.

Thanks,

Possible Security Group Issue (master/product vs. account),DPSA-20919,651213,,System Error,Closed,DPSA,DPS Asset Management,software,aoma-as,,,Major,Issue Rejected,kmccar1,kmccar1,kmccar1,16/May/17 6:34 PM,22/Aug/25 2:18 AM,12/Oct/25 4:12 PM,22/Aug/25 2:18 AM,,,,16/May/17 12:00 AM,0,,,,"Hi team,
 
I came across this issue this morning while reviewing an export job for product 88985436482. Please review and let me know if you have any further questions.

The following 4 masters are linked to 88985436482. Please note the security group affiliation for each. 

000010393746 - Packaging Graphics Master (FR) - STICKER / Security Group: France
000010363506 - Packaging Graphics Master (US) / Security Groups: Columbia, Columbia Confidential
000010363527 - Cover Master / Security Groups: Columbia, Columbia Confidential
000010122239 - Audio Master DDP / Security Group: Columbia Confidential

Release date: 06/02/2017 (pre-release) 

AOMA account: amtest1 
Account is set with full access (pre- / post-release) to France. Account does not have the Export All Security Groups permission. 

1. Search for product 88985436482
Audio, Cover, and Graphics master icons appear in the Results (Screenshot-1)
a. Clicking on the audio master icon results in a blank screen (Screenshot-2 - this is correct, user should not have access to the audio master)
b. Clicking on the cover master icon allows the user to access the Graphic Details UI, select the cover for QuickConvert, Export, Add to collection, etc (Screenshot-3) This is incorrect - the user should not have access to this cover image as it is associated only with Columbia and Columbia Confidential. 
c. Clicking on the graphic master icon allows the user access to the Graphic Details UI for BOTH packaging graphics masters. (Screenshot-4) User should not have access to the US Territory master as it is NOT associated with France.  

2. From the Export UI, after selecting a destination (Direct Mail Delivery in this example), the amtest1 account is able to select the cover, and both packaging Graphics masters for export (Screenshot-5) I do not want to actually trigger the export, as this is a pre-release product for a major artist on Columbia.  

3. Please note in Screenshot-6 that all of the associated security groups are noted under ""Security Groups,"" giving the appearance that all of the masters share the same groups.

Sandeep;;;","02/May/17 5:09 PM;mcatande;The behavior in Jira with the attached screenshot images may be more desirable in terms of how the images are displayed in AOMA. 

If you click Mathilde's screenshots above you can see Jira's image preview window adds a small white border and the X circle button (to close the pop-up) is not over or obstructing the actual image in any way. 
Also when the pop-up window is activated the background turns a translucent gray so one can still see what's behind the pop up window but it doesn't distract from the pop up.  

There is also an arrow selector that allows the user to move on to the next image to be previewed. Perhaps we should activate this in the VIC selection interface as well where a user doesn't have to close the pop-up window and it just cycles back and forth between the available images for selection?  
Could the pop-up window also include an option to select the new approved VIC within that window? ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After clicking on a link (it can be anything) the AOMA icon in the browser tab does not start ""spinning"" as it does in Firefox and Google Chrome. This gives the appearance that the link is not working. After a few seconds, the new page loads. 

This is especially troublesome for Direct / Simple Upload. After the Aspera upload completes, the browser window remains still. After a few moments (or minutes, depending upon the amount of files transferred), the UI will reload and provide the confirmation message.

This Product has a 2nd Cocktail component and this failure is related to the track(s) on the cocktail component.

Do we still support these?

I can't remember: is there a special process we have to go thru to process updates for these?

Whenever I upload poster art backfill into Digital Video Longplay using asset submission tool, there's always a PSD file that fails registration. I currently have one product that isn't urgent for you to review, product number G010003304503D. I backfill 6 to 7 files that include 2 PSD files and one of them always fails.

It's strange that it one file fails. I upload the folder with files into my migration folder then using the asset submission I registration them.

This issue stems from concurrent registration attempts, which can lead to a deadlock on the database side. It may occur across any asset type.

As a temporary workaround, if you encounter registration failures during multi-asset registration, please retry the failed assets individually. They should register successfully upon retry.

We are currently analyzing the root cause and will keep you updated on our findings.

In AOMA everything seemed fine, the cover has been uploaded correctly, specs ok.

The only clue we have is that when we download it from AOMA it is flipped on his side.

 

We decided to create a new master, reupload the cover and hot swap it. I think it resolves the issue as the cover is now good on the Catalog Spotify.

 

We have kept the problematic master to investigate more on this issue and understand what could have been the problem here.

Stéphanie;;;","21/Aug/25 3:21 PM;mcatande;[~dure05] - Yes. in an image file there is the ability to add header data (exif) data which instructs a computer to display the image in a certain orientation.  I believe this is rooted in taking images with a camera when it is flipped on its side and then changing the orientation to make that image upright.

*Subject:* Mixed product error - export to CES

Hello all,

 

I want to bring an error to your attention that we experience +every single time+ when we export masters of mixed products (e.g. product# 19802927792: 2x audio DDPs + 1x BDCMF) to destination: {_}Manufacturing - Central European Services (CES){_}.

The error is: only one master category (either Audio DDP *OR* BDCMF) is showing up as “available” in European Services CMG as party entry.

 

We do use a workaround since years where I do export one master category, CES sends these masters to the pressing plant and then I export the other master category and those masters then are forwarded to the pressing plant, too.

This is not ideal, but I don’t know how complex it would be to get this error fixed and if it’s an AOMA or a CMG bug.

 

 

This is an sample export that I did this morning:

 

As you can see in the CMG screenshot: although I did successfully export all 3 masters at the same time, only the 2 audio DDPs are available: - the BDCMF is not available

 

*Additional note:*  If I would exporting the BDCMF master now to Manufacturing - Central European Services (CES), then the 2 audio DDPs will disappear.

 

Thanks for looking into this for me.

This issue here is, if both masters on a product, with a mix of virtually linked DDPs and Bly-Ray masters, are exported to CES during the same export attempt, only the audio master gets delivered to CES, even though AOMA shows that both the audio and Blu-Ray were successfully delivered.

Note, Constanze's CES contact is Spatharis, Monika, European Services <monika.spatharis.external@sonymusic.com>. We've reached to Monika for further information. She can confirm this happens for any (DDP+Blu-Ray) product exported to CES under Constanze's account. She is checking if this happens for other users.

_From Monika (Teams): ""The only thing I can say is that we do have issues every time Constanze transfers CD AND BluRay masters at the same time. In the past we therefore helped ourselves by first transferring the CD masters, which we then forwarded to the manufacturer, and after that  the BluRay masters were uploaded and transferred. However, this cannot be a permanent solution, can it?""_

Thanks,

I believe this is the same issue as https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/DPSA-26666. Workaround should be to submit the two exports individually. I've also linked the fix ticket for the issue.

Hi [~fehn001],

Sorry for the delay on this one. It will be resolved once they officially move the physical production workflow to A3. We'll keep you posted.

Please let us know if you need anything else for now, and sorry for the inconvenience here.

Keith;;;","18/Jul/25 5:19 PM;mcatande;Point being, everything was looking good in AOMA.  SME Germany suspected the issues were due to the virtual master being. a mix of wav and trk sourced 16bit, but this was clearly not the case.  Appears to be some type of messaging issue?  
If yes, what went wrong and can we systemically tweak anything to ensure this doesn't happen in the future. Could it be a bug with the new kafka messaging? ;;;","18/Jul/25 6:11 PM;gvamsik;Fiona reached out to me separately this morning, and I re-sent the Kafka messages, which should have resolved the issue. As far as I see , there are no problems with the Kafka messages. All Link (product/track master relationship) messages were sent simultaneously when the link occurred yesterday. However, I noticed some of these assets are from 2011 and 2013, before Kafka was in place.

From the Export UI (screenshot-2), it appears that the virtually linked BluRay and DDP masters are ""Sharing"" a master ID. Is it possible that this is causing the overwriting of the BluRay component in the CES system?

The exports from our side seem fine and in theory it should be going to two different locations but you might be right about the single master getting overwritten as I am not sure how the CES side handles this. Would it be possible to trigger the CES export for the ddp, then we resubmit the blueray export and see if it shows up then?

1. My colleague Johanna created a virtual component to combine 2x CD audio DDPs with a Blu-ray BDCMF master (000022198877).

She exported all the masters manually to CES.

CES let her know that the “Blu-ray master is not available anymore”

!image-2022-07-04-11-13-46-488.png!

 2. My colleague exported manually just the BD master to CES then.

Result: the 2x CD audio DDPs were “not available anymore”, but the new export of the BD master was instead.

CES asked of getting the audio DDPs exported again.

!image-2022-07-04-11-13-55-091.png!

 3. My colleague exported the 2x audio CD DDP manually to CES again

Result: the Blu-ray master was “not available anymore”

CES now decided to export the 2x audio DDP CDs to Sonopress first & once they are at the manufacturer my colleague will manually export the BD master to CES again…
!image-2022-07-04-11-14-05-149.png!

So the issue that we had back in December (see mail thread below) still exists.

BTW: I think I have another idea what might create this issue (in the back-end).
Usually you have two buttons available for simple upload when you have a combo product (Audio CD + BD)After my colleague initially uploaded the audio DDPs via simple upload the simple upload button for uploading a BD master was gone.
That’s the reason why she had to create a virtual component (after she created both masters for audio & BD manually via “master create”)

Checking this out.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","20/Aug/25 5:10 PM;chin023;These were prepped as ""dummy videos"" as placeholders. Now noticing they are solid black, which is likely tripping out the black/curtain detect features. Let us know if that is the case, and we can create and submit something else.;;;","20/Aug/25 5:15 PM;spag001;Hi all,

So UST has a workflow to automatically trigger auto-correct if the only issue is Front or Back black tail detection. Auto-correct will then add the missing data and then proceed as normal via the registration. It looks in this case however auto-correction is failing to add the data and it keeps looping because of it. As of now I'm going to fail the in-progress job.

Hi [~gmp],

Can we manually add the black front to this file? I'll need to review with the team why the auto correct CT failed to add it.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","20/Aug/25 5:19 PM;spag001;[~chin023] ah okay yeah that seems to be the case. Yeah can something else be created. I'll create a UST fix ticket for the looping issue. Is it possible we can get that file for testing since its a dummy file?

;;;","12/Aug/25 5:05 PM;jdunca1;Hey Charlie. There is something with this one. I attempted to run it via ffmpeg and got the same error. I ran a conversion (dsf to dsf via Tascam), but it is adding a pop. I'm going to see if I can find another way to just re-run it as a dsf to clear it.

 ;;;","12/Aug/25 8:52 PM;jdunca1;Hey Charlie. This should be clear now. Let me know.

Keith;;;","06/Aug/25 11:20 PM;woom001;neither of these VSC validation issues seems accurate;

can we export the VSC using CT 2087 to determine what the actual dimensions of the VSC are? 640x384 is 1.66 ratio and does not sound right.

validation error 2 says the dpi is only 8 when it should be 72; this also does not sound accurate to the system in place.

thanks.;;;","06/Aug/25 11:37 PM;spag001;Hi all,

To my understanding for this video dimensions/crop with this combination the math is a little bit weird due to the nature of letterbox. I think we'll need to go over this but for now I would recommend registering this as a standalone image if possible.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","06/Aug/25 11:48 PM;woom001;Hi [~spag001]

i think the issue here is with the validation; going over the math here, 640x384 is the correct aspect ratio of the video (1.66) with crops 52,56,10,12 (698x372) converted to square pixel and scaled to standard width (640).

trying to find the ticket on 2087/4087, but it looks like the clean crop image is being scaled to standard size; the validation will always fail as it's comparing it against clean crop (non-square) dimensions;

would validation upon registration fail if we tried to manually register a 640x384 or 620x372 to the product number?

Weve been trying to use MBC for Mobile Tone exports since Batch Export via Mobile Audio Manager is going / gone. 

Having some issues getting all of the products to export, previously there was a known issue with virtually linked masters.

I attempted this batch this afternoon and only received a few of the products.

Would someone be able to take a look and confirm, or perhaps were not selecting the correct options in the MBC interface.

Keith;;;","24/Jun/25 7:29 PM;spag001;Hi [~venu001],

Can you review this one with the team?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","01/Jul/25 12:09 PM;stef003;Hi [~tobi017],

Apologies for the delayed response regarding the root cause of the issue.

Could you please confirm whether the following tracks (02, 07, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22) had ISRCs assigned at the time of export? We have identified a bug in the A3 export process where tracks *without assigned ISRCs* are delivered under the same name. This leads us to suspect that the ISRCs for these tracks may have been empty.

Additionally, we noticed that some tracks, such as track 26, 28 and 36, had dummy ISRCs (isrc26, Isrc28, isrc36). This might be related to how the master was created.

_Please note: This issue only occurs on the master details page. Productized exports are not affected._

We are working on a fix. _C.C._ [~venu001]

Thank you,
Vitalii;;;","01/Jul/25 4:12 PM;mcatande;[~stef003] - Good catch on the missing ISRC issue. If we're looking for a fix. I suggest when an ISRC is not assigned we use the AOMA Track Master ID in place of the ISRC in the file name.  ;;;","23/Jul/25 4:00 AM;venu001;Fix pushed in build

[~tobi017] can you give this a try again and see if the issue persists? Should be good now;;;","07/Aug/25 8:29 PM;tobi017;Hi Manu - 

This appears to be resolved, just tested the same master and havent experienced it with other exports.

Could you please advise for Johan?

Thanks,

Keith;;;","28/May/25 8:36 PM;rhayloc;The AOMA preview was able to push past the corrupt frames, but other encoders usually do not- they crash and fail the render. If by chance they do finish the file, it often has a green or red solid frame where the processing fails on the corrupt frames- a corrupt ""hit"". Either way, this product has not been able to deliver in this state despite attempts to fix/ re-encode the master. I just tried again with Adobe ME and it crashed- screen grabs attached. I see the bad frames at around 20 seconds in on the master when the close up of the guitarist's hand- see attached.

We have had this specific video flagged several times over the years and should replace it or remove it- each time we get a report on the failure we have several team members from delivery, ops, and media production take a lot of time to look into it and try to resolve. I just happened to recall the last times I worked on this and realize it is still unresolved and failing.

Adding- it's out of my wheelhouse a bit but.. I think it may also be possible to put this on a blocking table so it does not deliver again, if purging it is not desirable. May need Account Management to advise on that.

1) AOMA - Link Assets to the replacement Products in AOMA 

2) GRPS, EOM - Publish, Order and Deliver the replacement Products 

3) GRPS - Cancel and Scrap the old products (This will change the Publish Status to Pending Scrapped and begin revoking the Products from Partners) 

4) GRPS - Once Revokes are processed, the Product will move from Pending Scrapped to Scrapped (automatically)

Keith;;;","17/Jun/25 9:46 PM;mcatande;Hey All, 

There's 'deleting the asset' and then there is revoking the product.

Note that this is an active product, live at select outlets, {+}generating revenue{+}, but.. it's non-maintainable. The asset is corrupt and this product cannot be subsequently delivered to any other partners or updated. 

Revoking the product will make it unavailable anywhere ever again and it will no longer be available where it currently is and will no longer generate any revenue.  

In the past, we've discussed this same issue as these corrupt assets come back in tickets to haunt us regularly.  The decision in the past has been to keep the product live and not revoke. We created [https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/AMSE-917] to create an indicator for Supply Chain users to know this product is non-maintainable due to file corruption. 

Before this is revoked, wanted to put this out there.  ;;;","23/Jun/25 4:47 PM;anem002;If everyone is ok with the solution Mike suggest I'm happy with doing that.;;;","06/Aug/25 4:43 PM;rhayloc;I am fine with Mike's solution above...

A registration of a 24 Bit WAV asset swap with the downconvert to 16 Bit WAV option checked caused some confusion today due to the validation error: ""The bit depth specified in the file name does not match the bit depth of the master type. Bit depth 16 value expected, but was 24 instead.""

Can you please review Job ID: 2706980, on G010005603362J from today? Was the validation error a temporary glitch during the downconvert process? FYI, the registration completed successfully.

Note, the file was named ""Master - Jeg Lovar (Main) [16 bit] V3_pre2 (1).wav"" and was a 24 Bit WAV file despite having '...[16 bit] in the name.

Fiona;;;","05/Aug/25 9:07 PM;spag001;Hi all,

For the job in validation error status it looks like the downconvert flag might have accidently not been clicked (data from the job is below) which is why the job failed. The other time is was correctly enabled so the file was downconverted correctly which is why it passed. Let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Thanks

[~tang002] We will want to pull the logs for the export IDs for G010005569473W. We will need to reg the video and SCC file in Stage to a dummy product, order a DMDS to a test folder, check the MXF output and compare the logs. This is somewhat I priority to resolve, though the delivery for this was already completed manually.

for background:

DMDS export for G010005569473W (4K video with SCC registration) arrives at the partner with an empty CC track; no closed captions despite there being a 608 track created.

other recent DMDS exports have CC track, and G0100055621370 which contains the same/similar SCC (but different video) was exported as a test to DMDS and has CC.

this doesn't look like DPSA-30190, there have been no recent vantage upgrades and other products are being delivered with CC.

we thought it could have been the SCC file itself was bad, but a hot-swap with a new SCC file resulted in the same at the partner, a video with CC track but no CC's.

guessing it could be the combination of this video (4K) with this SCC in conversion, but can't really tell. hoping the vantage logs might shed some light on what's going here.

thanks.;;;","31/Jul/25 10:22 PM;tang002;Hi AOMA team, can you help to retreat the request ID of this faulty registration? ;;;","01/Aug/25 3:58 PM;kori002;Hi [~venu001]  

Please check this out as soon as possible.;;;","01/Aug/25 4:40 PM;venu001;This is a UST registration (if Original File Name is populated), and no CT is used in conversion. As such, no conversion request ID was generated during registration [~tang002]

Unlike FFMPEG, Vantage workflow doesn't provide an all-in-one log for the job. Instead, it's progress bar and session metadata for each tile. And to save disk space, we delete the job once it is completed successfully from Vantage. 
Let me pull those sources to Stage and trigger a conversion, once it's done I'll save the job history and see if I can get anything out of it.
Thanks!;;;","04/Aug/25 10:03 PM;tang002;Hi [~rhayloc], [~woom001] ,

I manually executed the job in Stage Vantage. As I mentioned earlier, Vantage doesn't have the type of all-in-one log output, but I've saved the job history there and feel free to log in to the Vantage server and check any action tiles or job info there (video output location on the server: E:\VantageLocalTest\CAV392500034_G010005569473W.mxf). Let me share the MediaInfo for the output here, and feel free to let me know if there is anything need from my end.

thanks; i've looked at the file and compared the mediainfo stats; this file does not have a CC (text) track. i'll need to log in and check the manual job log to see what's going on here; the video framerate is 23.98 and is like the most used action tile for DMDS; users have reported that other exports contain CC track.

Duration: 01:09:20|;;;","09/May/25 8:22 PM;kmccar1;Just to recap a bit on this issue, as discussed today. Long term fix would be to make sure that the entries in the ""Notifications"" tab remain as they were after an unexpected log-out. That way, the prior upload job can either be resumed, or at least the upload status provided.

In the meantime, I think it's best that Tim signs out and back into the system prior to starting a new upload after any period of inactivity. Hopefully this will ensure that there are no log outs during the upload process. Let's see how it goes on your end next week, [~mart036]. Feel free to update this ticket or reach out via Teams.

The GRAS Export is currently down in production. We are in the ""scream test"" phase before its final decommissioning.

Publish status updates are now handled by the RDX CDC process. It appears that GRPS is still calling the GRAS EXPORT web service concurrently with RDX CDC, although it should no longer be doing so.

If you notice any missing publish status updates, please let us know so we can investigate.

Thanks,
Alem;;;","23/Jul/25 4:06 PM;dewi013;Hi Alem,

Thanks I'm looking in to this as we did test sending bulk publish messages when MI moved to RDX so this is a little strange.

Trudi;;;","23/Jul/25 6:05 PM;kiss015;Hello [~zeki001] / [~vleung1]
Under RDX-640 most of the publish related messaging was migrated to the new RDX channel and in the past months they were sent out both on the old and new interface. Now for those the parallel testing phase is done as I see so we can decomission the old service.
I'd like to just clarify one point: on RDX-640 not all of the messages were moved over, the ones implemented in RPS-7993 are not included in the new channnel (though some parts may be covered as I am checking).
Are you OK with completely stopping the old service and only continue sending via RDX?

I investigated the RDX channel service configurations and we are good. They cover the old ""publish_auto"" without gaps (in fact they send change info about more changes).
I also checked our database for the last ~ 1.5 months and no discrepancies.

I executed the following selects:
-- all successful notifications on the old ""pub"" channel with type ""publish_auto"" (implementation of RPS-7993)
select * from vgra030 a where channel_id = 22 and notification_type = 'publish_auto' and mod_stamp > '20250601' and a.response_code = '200'
9815 rows

-- all successful notifications on the ""pub"" channel with type ""publish_auto"" and no corresponding RDX notification for the same subject (product #) + transaction (transaction is checked to ensure that the same save triggered it)
select * from vgra030 a where channel_id = 22 and notification_type = 'publish_auto' and mod_stamp > '20250601' and a.response_code = '200'
and not exists (select * from vgra030 b where b.channel_id = 54 and a.subject_id = b.subject_id and a.orig_revision_notif_id = b.orig_revision_notif_id)
0 rows

-- report of the ""publish_auto"" - RDX notification pairs
select * from vgra030 a, vgra030 b where a.channel_id = 22 and a.notification_type = 'publish_auto' and a.mod_stamp > '20250601'
and b.channel_id = 54 and a.subject_id = b.subject_id and a.orig_revision_notif_id = b.orig_revision_notif_id
9815 rows (just like the first select)

The attached [DPSA-31237.xlsx] file contains the paired notifications, the old channel with white background, the new with green.
They are connected via columns F to AE and O to AN. It can be used for spot checking notifications if needed.

Hari;;;","08/Apr/25 5:59 PM;pala017;Hi [~CHIN023] - Found the root cause for the failure, ""–"" in the main folder seems to be the issue here as the system when decodes converts to an accented symbol as ""Yung Bleu â€“ Miss It 6-26-17 USE"". Looks like it's not a regular hyphen. If possible, can you please give a try uploading via aspera by replacing this character or removing it? If you are facing the issue again, please give a try   from S3 since the object is already available in GMP S3 bucket.

Primary Product: *G0100055971967*
 * Expected Dolby Atmos Mapping:
*GBARL2401535* is currently linked as a Related Dolby Atmos ISRC. It points to Dolby product {*}G010005389965N{*}, which correctly contains the Dolby ISRC: {*}GBARL2401541{*}. This product is confirmed to be a Dolby Atmos release with a registered Dolby master.

 * Inconsistency Identified:
A separate stereo product, {*}G010005391907W{*}, has a registered WAV 16-bit master with ISRC GBARL2401560.
However, this stereo product is also referencing *GBARL2401535 *as a Related Dolby Atmos ISRC.
Additionally, G010005391907W lists a related product link back to {*}G0100055971967{*}(the original stereo product).

 * Problem Summary:
{*}GBARL2401535{*}, which is a stereo ISRC, is incorrectly being used as a Related Dolby Atmos ISRC in another stereo product. This creates a conflict, as *GBARL2401535* is: The primary stereo ISRC for *G0100055971967,* Also being treated as a Dolby Atmos ISRC in *G010005391907W.* The correct Dolby ISRC is *GBARL2401541* and should be the only one used for Atmos linkage.

 * Recommendation:
Please review the performance_rel_audio_isrc_map entries and correct the mapping to:
Ensure GBARL2401535 is used only as a stereo ISRC and Replace any incorrect Atmos references with the valid Dolby ISRC: GBARL2401541

It shouldn’t happen again. The video engineers should be checking the dimensions of the VSC against the registered video’s resolution before locking the QC notes. 

 

@Sony Music-US, AOMA Support would you mind looking into why cropping metadata was added during the UST autocorrected registration, as the video contains full frame active pixels as well as pillar bars (inactive pixels) 

 

In the meantime, I’ll send a message to the video engineers to ensure they double check this during QC.

This video has both full frame (16:9) and pillar bars (4:3) throughout. The majority of the video has pillar bars, which is why I think the UST autocorrect added cropping metadata. Due to the full frame sections the engineer deleted the autocorrected cropping metadata but forgot to update the VSC. The VSC has been fixed and registered as full frame (16:9) as intended.

Hey All, 
 
UST for SFV has crop detection built in. It automatically adds crop data and the engineer is currently expected to validate that crop info and confirm both the video and VSC are as intended. 
As we are aware of the risk with the auto-crop logic, we have an enhancement open to modify this auto-crop logic to suggest crop data settings instead of automatically fill out the crop data settings.  
Ticket here: [https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/AMSE-1174|https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.smedigitalapps.com%2Fjira%2Fbrowse%2FAMSE-1174&data=05%7C02%7Cfiona.burgess.ext%40sonymusic.com%7C12afe85ccf1a4f6a6f9a08ddce9e8569%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C638893902657484631%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oVl65itShM8y5WcuXREwwnvl%2Bq0tXFgH1gEM%2BYJjDRQ%3D&reserved=0]

Hi team,

 

I am encountering an issue when attempting to place an order for the product listed below. The EOM2 panel displays a message stating that the product is not registered. It appears that the ""EOM Message Sender"" feature has been reactivated; however, when I try to submit the product through this feature, I receive an error indicating that the message could not be sent.

 

 

I suspect that my account may need to be reactivated in order to proceed. I would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently, as I need to complete the ordering process for this product as soon as possible.

 

 

Regards,

Cemre

Hi There,

The DSP WiMP says the 30 sec previews on 2 of our releases are only ""white noise""!

The previews seems fine in AOMA to me?

Hello, Jan

We tested the 30 second previews and the full length clips for the tracks on each product and they played without any issue. 

Please check to make sure that you have the latest version of your internet browser installed (How do I update my browser?: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001388.htm), as well as the latest version of Adobe Flash (http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). 
Once this is verified, please clear your internet browser cache and history, then completely close all your browser windows to ensure the program is shut down. Then open a fresh browser window, log in, and try previewing the clips again.",,aoma-as,aoma-del,cbrice1,ewood01,karls08,kmccar1,mbrice1,morte02,ohme01,rbarry1,roraj01,ssingh3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,Digital Audio Track,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,"<font color=""red"">AOMA Support</font><br><b>Hours:</b> Monday-Friday, 3:30 am-8:00 pm EST <br><b>Emergency After-Hours Support:</b> Send an email to <a href=""mailto:aoma.support@sonymusic.com"">aoma.support@sonymusic.com</a> with the JIRA ticket number and a brief description.",,,,,19/Feb/14 12:00 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"G010003119067Z, G010003113090O",,,,,,,,,,"2|hvdc87:",47039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ohme01,,No,,,,,,,"19/Feb/14 12:48 PM;ewood01;Jan responded to my troubleshooting recommendations:

Appears we have the same old issue we have with cover art.  Our analysis tools fail to pick up the Dpi metadata.  Both photoshop and Apple Preview App are showing them dpi as 72. 

My only thought is the software assumes 72dpi when the header data is not there. 

A 'save as' in photoshop worked and also an 'export as' also worked and I was able to register both.

I have attached the original file for Alexandre Pires - G010005557068J as well as a 'save as' and an 'export as' version of the image including txt output of the metadata using exifreader

We have the enhancement open for fixing the 'invalid units' issue and this appears to be the same. ",,bsahoo1,hale002,kmccar1,kori002,mcatande,spag001,venu001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ITSM-71108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18/Jul/25 6:25 PM;kmccar1;Re_ Issue - Upload VCA.zip;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2609254/Re_+Issue+-+Upload+VCA.zip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Undetermined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3l85r:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,,false,,Good,,,,,,,,,,SME Supply Chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,michael.catandella@sonymusic.com,,No,,,,,,,"18/Jul/25 7:06 PM;kmccar1;HI team,

Attached is a user guideline for uploading archives using TUSD. Please note that if you have both TUSD and ASPERA upload permissions, the system will default to using TUSD when you *drag and drop* folders.
However, if you use the *“Select Folders”* option, you will be able to choose whether to upload using TUSD or ASPERA. Thanks!

First, as a down conversion when registering the 24bit 44.1khz master (side 2 registered without issue)

I tried another time. This time, I downconverted the files to 16bit manually before attempting to register, and it still fails.

Hi,
 
How are you?
 
I'm getting the below error message when I try to upload artwork for a pseudo video.  It's a Jpeg, 1920 x 1080, 300dpi, so I'm not sure why it isn't working.
 
Many thanks,
Susanna

This master was originally created for this other product; so when its linked to the product listed in this DPSA, its just re-using that same master data (and why its showing twice on G010005259865A).

We are still experiencing issues with the label copy generated from AOMA during our export processes. I’ve attached an example below for your reference.
The manufacturer (in this case, Sonopress) has now raised concerns, as the label copy is incorrect with *every* export. The manual processes (such as retrieving label copy from DX) are causing additional manual effort across the board.
Could you please investigate this issue in more detail and let me know when a fix can be expected?
Thanks,
Kai

Shanaj from the GRPS team pointed out linked ticket GRPSS-5065 today. The UK team had two products that had audio (16bit WAV and Dolby Atmos Full Master) linked, but no cover masters. The user(s) had inadvertently gone into GRPS and Full Published, later realizing that the products had no cover assets.

The first product is currently in it's original state - Full Published without a cover master linked. The second product had the cover master added around 5 of 10 this morning EST but had been Full Published without it prior to that time.

The email format looks A2 to me but could you please let me know?;;;","16/Jul/25 6:05 PM;halv001;Yes, I used AOMA 2 QC notes. ;;;","16/Jul/25 6:09 PM;kori002;Sure, thank you. Could you let me know why A3 interface was not used here? Does A3 interface missed anything that A2 offers or any issues with A3? 

If we use A3 the email format looks a bit different ad hence the AOMA url also redirects to A3 pages without any error. With the plan of retiring A2 interfaces in near future we would need to think if we need to work on the URL redirection resulted from A2 QC notes usage. ;;;","16/Jul/25 6:45 PM;halv001;I must've used AOMA 2 by old habit, I have been trying to use AOMA 3 when possible. I was unaware it would cause an issue to use AOMA 2.

There was a big of a lag spike on the kafka consumer that handles the ingestion for these uploads which caused the slowdown. The system caught back up so you should be all good. We are also introducing some changes in the build that should help prevent this.

Currently this virtual master has 19 of 20 tracks linked, tracks 1 through 18 and 20. We need to link the final track to the product Track 19.  Master ID 27250738 side 1 track 1 

We use the A2 linking interface to do this as A3 does not yet support editing/adding tracks to virtual masters for stereo wav. 

When we go into the A2 interface the current linked data is not present: 

!image-2025-07-17-16-12-15-957.png|width=1334,height=623!

No master or track data is present. Normally we'd just add the data for track 19 and commit the link to add the new track. 

This is what the 16 bit virtual master on the same product looks like, note the data included:

I am experiencing a display issue on a vinyl product.

I have registered a 2 component vinyl through Direct Upload; the upload was successful and the 4 audio files are registered in the correct order in Aoma, but on the master detail page I see the titles and ISRC of side A on all 4 sides of the vinyl. If I check the product detail page instead, the titles are correct for all components but there are ISRC mismatches on side B, C and D.

 

Would you be able to look into that please?

Thanks!

For clarification you were doing a TUS upload and the browser updated? That would likely have an impact on the upload.

I was checking the original job and it looks like it was hanging for a while but actually as of 35 minutes ago started uploading again. Did you retrigger it from the browser or did the update finish?

Thanks

Matthew;;;","09/Jul/25 10:41 PM;spag001;Hi [~akrikor],

It looks like the old job should wrap up soon. My assumption based off the time is the resubmission retriggered the original upload though gonna investigate why it did that. When submitting the new attempt did you refresh the UST UI or did you just resubmit a fresh job?

Hi amp team,

Could you review the amp asset key of ""8425cde6-3408-44cf-aa32-e9f73424d739"".  It was stuck for a while then retriggered close to when the reattempt with the same asset file was made which with ""1e3afe8d-fe64-4298-8133-25592cc742c8"". It might have been just coincidence and the browser restart from the update retrigger the job but just want to double check.

Thanks

I registered a master (27216500) only via Direct Upload of the fourteen tracks - I can't run the AQC or get those AQC notes in on this master though. That said, the tracks are linked to the product, and the manual QC notes have been entered and should be able to be locked. 

[https://aoma.smcdp-de.net/aoma-ui/master/27216500/information/qc-notes?product=G010005593684A]

DEV team should be able to help fix master 27213355, which will allow for locking the QC Notes there, and adding in track 10 once it's available. We can remove the virtual master at that point and replace with the original. Please let me know if this works for now. 

Thanks,

Hello Support, according to DX the LC complete date was on May 26th. The AOMA Export to Sonopress was four days later. Please check why the labelcopy (attached) was incomplete. There is no need to export the master again. We forwarded the LC manually to Sonopress.

I have two folders in the AOMA Archive that seem to be stuck in Asset Upload in Progress. 

This is under AOMA Archive Package Master Number: 27216773

I tried to manually cancel my first folder upload called ""WestLife_MyLove_ProRes_Rushes_35mm"" but this still says Asset Upload in Progress on the system. I can't delete this either, the ""X"" next to the folder is greyed out for me. 

The second folder upload ""WestLife_MyLove_ProRes_Rushes_35mm_NewUpload"" still says Asset Upload in Progress, even though no upload is progressing anymore. 

Is it possible to: 

1. Delete the first folder upload ""WestLife_MyLove_ProRes_Rushes_35mm"" for me?

and 

2. Check the real status of the second folder upload (""WestLife_MyLove_ProRes_Rushes_35mm_NewUpload"")? I suspect it failed too but please check. (If it did fail please delete it and I'll try again using Aspera tonight).

On further analysis, I have observed that product and project are associated with master and status of these are showing pending because there is no registration initiated.

Please ask them to initiate registration and do let me know if they find any issue. Once registration completed successfully, status will get updated with Registered.

Could you please check in on these two auto-correct jobs? Are they still moving?

Thanks,

Keith;;;","28/May/25 5:52 PM;spag001;Hi all,

These auto-corrected jobs were triggered 10 minutes before the maintenance window and unfortunately it looks like they got caught in step when some of the apps had to restart. I don't have a good way to resubmit these on where they got stuck in the backend so I've failed both of these so they can be manually resubmitted.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks

Matthew;;;","28/May/25 5:58 PM;kmccar1;Got it, I figured it was close to the window last night. Thanks [~spag001].

[~gonz019], both products should be set for you to try a reupload now. Let us know if you have any further issues.

Thanks,

Keith;;;","28/May/25 6:01 PM;gonz019;Will do, thanks team!;;;","03/Jul/25 4:54 AM;gonz019;Hi [~kmccar1],

This ticket can be closed.

Best,

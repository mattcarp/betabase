We need to support Printing Specifications in the UST Packaging Graphics.
• In the Packaging Graphics Master section, display the following details in the header bar:

*Packaging Graphics Master title - Master ID - Region - comments*

{color:#de350b}*Packaging Graphics Master - 5439031 - Germany (DE) - Digipack*{color}

• Below this header, add a “Printing Specifications” button.
• When a user clicks this button, a popup should appear. The popup should replicate the layout and fields from the existing legacy Packaging Printing Specifications configuration.
• In the popup:
        A bar should display *Printing Specification - Master ID - Region - Comments*
        The form area should contain the same sections and fields as the legacy version
        Auto-population: Product Type should be automatically filled based on the Product Configuration.
        All other fields and behavior should remain consistent with the legacy Packaging Printing Specifications.

!Printing Specifications Pop-up.png|width=548,height=389!
+*User Story:*+

*As a* user,

*I want* to access and edit printing specifications directly from the Packaging Graphics Master section in UST

*so that* I can manage printing details for different product types

+*Acceptance Criteria*+

1. Header info shows in PKGF graphics section

*Given* the user has navigated to the UST - Graphics - Packaging Graphics section and opened a Packaging Graphics Master,
*When* the master details load,
*Then* the header displays *Packaging Graphics Master - Master ID - Region - comments.*

2. “Printing Specifications” button

*Given* the user is viewing a Packaging Graphics Master in the Packaging Graphics section,
*When* the user clicks “Printing Specifications” button,
*Then* a popup opens.

3. Popup content

*Given* the Printing Specifications popup is open,
*When* it renders,
*Then* the popup has a bar shows *Printing Specification - Master ID - Region - Comments*

4. Legacy parity of form

*Given* the Printing Specifications popup is open,
*When* the page loads,
*Then* the layout and fields match the legacy Packaging Printing Specifications one-for-one

5. Product Type auto-population

*Given* the master has a Product Configuration,
*When* the popup loads,
*Then* Product Type is auto-populated from the Product Configuration

*Given* the Package Printing Specification popup window is open,
*When* the Product Type field is pre-populated from the product configuration,
*Then* the Product Type dropdown should still remain editable, allowing users to open the dropdown and customize or change the value if needed.

6. Product Configuration missing

*Given* the master has no Product Configuration
*When* the popup loads,
*Then* the Product Type field remains blank (no auto-population)

7. For ""Close"" button

*Given* the Package Printing Specification popup window is open,
*When* the user clicks either the “Close” button or the “X” icon in the top-right corner,
*Then* the popup window should close.

*Given* the Package Printing Specification popup window is open,
*When* the user clicks anywhere outside of the popup or on other parts of the page,
*Then* the popup window should remain open and not close.

*Given* the user has made changes inside the Package Printing Specification popup but has not clicked “Save”,
*When* the user attempts to close the popup by clicking the “Close” button or the “X” icon,
*Then* the system should display a confirmation message such as:
“You have unsaved changes. If you close now, all unsaved information will be lost.”",,wang042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2713,,,,,,,,,,"10/Oct/25 7:21 PM;wang042;Printing Specifications Pop-up.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2714466/Printing+Specifications+Pop-up.png","03/Oct/25 10:42 PM;wang042;image - 2025-10-03T164157.549.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2705226/image+-+2025-10-03T164157.549.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3stzr:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10/Oct/25 7:18 PM;wang042;Refined on 10/6 refinement

To enhance metadata visibility for all video products, we need to display Track-Level ""Footage Type"" information on the Product Details Page.


Whenever the product is a video product, an additional column named ""Footage Type"" should appear in the Track-Level section. This column should show the corresponding footage type value for each track under that product.

Migrate Product Metadata Viewer Features to Product Details Page,UST-2696,1986951,,User Story,To Do,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,,,wang042,wang042,30/Sep/25 10:55 PM,10/Oct/25 7:08 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,,,,,,0,,"'+*Description*+

We want to consolidate the current Product Metadata Viewer functionality into the Product Details Page.
• The Product Metadata Viewer page should be simplified to only contain a Search Box for entering a Product Number and a “Load Product” button. Once the user clicks Load Product, they should be redirected to the Product Details Page showing all product details.

!Product Metadata Viewer UI.png|width=556,height=192!
• On the Product Metadata Viewer’s legacy page, there is a Country Release Date section that does not currently exist on the Product Details Page. We need to add this information on the Product Details Page:
1. Display it next to Release Date.
2. Add an Info Icon next to Release Date.
3. When a user clicks the Info Icon, a popup should appear showing a table of all country-specific release dates (e.g. Country Name, Release Date).

• The legacy page also contains a Bonus Material section, primarily for assets such as Digital Booklet Standard. We need to migrate this functionality into the Product Details Page:
1. Place this section below the Product Version Indicator section.
2. This section should be expandable/collapsible.
3. If the product contains Bonus Material, the section should be visible and expandable.
4. If the product does not contain any Bonus Material, the section should remain hidden.

• We need to include the “Footage Type” field. This field is currently displayed on the legacy Product Metadata Viewer page and should now be migrated and displayed on the Product Details Page to ensure continuity of metadata visibility for users.

Once these changes are complete, the legacy Product Metadata Viewer interface will be deprecated and reduced to the search + load flow only.

+*User Story*+

*As a* user,
*I want* to search for a product number and load its details on a unified Product Details Page,
*so that* I can view all product metadata (including Country Release Dates and Bonus Material) in one place without using multiple tools.

+*Acceptance Criteria*+

Scenario 1: Load Product from Metadata Viewer
*Given* a user enters a valid Product Number into the Product Metadata Viewer search box,
*When* the user clicks the Load Product button,
*Then* they should be redirected to the Product Details Page showing that product’s full details.

Scenario 2: Display Country Release Dates
*Given* a product has country-specific release dates in the backend,
*When* the user views the Product Details Page,
*Then* an Info Icon should appear next to the Release Date.
        *And* when the user clicks the Info Icon,
        *Then* a popup should display all Country Release Dates in a table format (Country Name, Release Date...)

Scenario 3: Country Release Dates absent
*Given* a product does not have country-specific release dates,
*When* the user views the Product Details Page,
*Then* no Info Icon should appear next to Release Date.

Scenario 4: Display Bonus Material Section
*Given* a product contains Bonus Material (e.g. Digital Booklet Standard),
*When* the user views the Product Details Page,
*Then* a Bonus Material expandable section should appear under the Product Version Indicator section.
        *And* when expanded,
        *Then* it should display the relevant Bonus Material assets.

Scenario 5: Bonus Material absent
*Given* a product does not contain Bonus Material,
*When* the user views the Product Details Page,
*Then* the Bonus Material section should remain hidden and not expandable.

Scenario 6: Metadata Viewer Simplification
*Given* a user accesses the Product Metadata Viewer,
*When* the changes are deployed,
*Then* the page should only display the Search Box and Load Product button, with all other metadata functionality migrated to the Product Details Page.

Scenario 7: Footage Type

*Given* the Product Details Page is loaded for a selected product,
*When* the product metadata is retrieved,
*Then* the field “Footage Type” should be displayed on the Product Details Page.
**

*Given* that the “Footage Type” value exists for a product in the legacy Product Metadata Viewer,
*When* the data migration is complete,
*Then* the same “Footage Type” value should appear on the Product Details Page.
**

*Given* that a product does not have a “Footage Type” value,
*When* the Product Details Page is loaded,
*Then* the “Footage Type” field should still be displayed with a blank or “N/A” value.

 

 

*Questions*
1. The legacy Product Metadata Viewer page has both a Product Search Box and a Master Search Box.
Do we need to make any changes to the Master Search Box as part of this work?
(remain as is, be migrated , or be removed entirely?) – no need to consider Master search

2. When accessing the Product Metadata Viewer via Product Number search, the page currently displays additional information such as Organization, Data Source, Barcode, Genre, P Line, and C Line.
Do we need to migrate these fields to the Product Details Page? – They're already there",,wang042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2731,,,,,,,,,,"10/Oct/25 6:58 PM;wang042;Footage Type.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2714415/Footage+Type.png","30/Sep/25 11:22 PM;wang042;Product Details Page 2.0.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2700455/Product+Details+Page+2.0.png","30/Sep/25 11:10 PM;wang042;Product Metadata Viewer UI.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2700417/Product+Metadata+Viewer+UI.png","30/Sep/25 11:23 PM;wang042;image-2025-09-30-17-23-14-609.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2700456/image-2025-09-30-17-23-14-609.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3sdzj:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10/Oct/25 6:44 PM;wang042;Refined on 10/6

Should the AQC email notification be an event based notification or by defult any uploader should get the notification ? - Should be event based & can use the QC notes event - Create 1 new event for notification Name -  AQC Reg. report
Attached notepad should it have track master id or master id ? 
If a product has 10 tracks and AQC done for 4 tracks we send out the email notification but after the user has registered the remaining 6 tracks should the 2nd email notification have all the 10 tracks or only 6 tracks ? - It should be consolidated all the time

*Notes for user story:*

When a user registers an asset and when the AQC is completed for that registered asset the user should get an email notification,
On that email notification there should be a notepad attachment with the AQC info in it, the attached notepad should have the following information ""Last Updated Date"", ""Master Id""
""Master type"", ""Artist"", ""Master Name"", ""Registered By"", ""Sequence number"", ""Track Name"", ""ISRC"", ""P-Line"", ""Actual Duration"", ""Entered Duration"" & ""AQC Notes""
On the body of the email notification we should have the following information:
Master details as on the registration email and below that there should be a table with the Asset ID, Track Master ID, Side #, Track #, Asset Name, Track Title, AQC Status, AQC Note.
If a product has 10 tracks and if the user registered only 4 assets and if the AQC was completed only for 4 assets then the email notification should be sent out and the 
attached notepad should have the details for the 4 tracks and the later when the user registers the remaining 6 tracks another email notification should be sent out which should include all the 10 tracks.
If the user goes ahead and swaps an asset for which the AQC is completed then the email notification should be sent out and the attachment should have all the 10 tracks and for the asset which had been swapped should have the text (Swapped) the email notification table should also have the same 10 tracks with the (Swapped) text next to it.

The registration email & the AQC email should be 2 separate email.

As a user registering a DBKS asset,
I want the system to automatically display a red error button on the master if any backend validation fails,
So that I can quickly see what went wrong and how to fix it without needing to refresh the browser.

*Acceptance Criteria*
*Scenario 1: Backend validation fails*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* one or more secondary (backend) validation checks fail,
*Then* the system should automatically display a red error button on the top-right corner of the master screen,
*And* this should happen in real time without requiring the user to refresh the browser.

*Scenario 2:* Error button click opens error details
*Given* a red error button is displayed on the top-right corner of the master screen,
*When* the user clicks on the red error button,
*Then* a pop-up window should appear,
*And* the pop-up should display all validation errors in red text,
*And* the corresponding solutions or recommendations should be displayed in blue text,
*And* the format and style should be consistent with how errors and solutions are shown on the ""cover"".

*Scenario 3: No backend validation errors*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* all secondary (backend) validation checks pass,
*Then* no red error button should appear on the master screen.

*Scenario 4: Real-time update*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* the backend validation completes,
*Then* the system should automatically update the UI (master screen) with the error button if applicable,
*And* this should occur without requiring a manual browser refresh or navigation.",,hale002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2197,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3sucf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MBC, when the user clicks on *Select Destination,* a popup window appears. At the top of this popup, there is a blue header bar that contains the popup title (Export) and a close button. Below the blue header bar, there is an Apply button.


Currently, when the user scrolls within the popup, the blue header bar and the Apply button also move along with the scrollbar. This causes the header and apply button to disappear from view.


The expected behavior is that the blue header bar and the Apply button remain fixed in place within the popup. They should always stay visible in the same position, regardless of user scrolling.

As a user registering a Vinyl 16b or 24b asset,

*Given* the user has submitted a Vinyl 16b or 24b asset registration request,
*When* one or more secondary (backend) validation checks fail,
*Then* the system should automatically display a red error button on the top-right corner of the master screen,

*Scenario 2:* Error button click opens error details
*Given* a red error button is displayed on the top-right corner of the master screen,
*When* the user clicks on the red error button,
*Then* a pop-up window should appear,
*And* the pop-up should display all validation errors in red text,
*And* the corresponding solutions or recommendations should be displayed in blue text,
*And* the format and style should be consistent with how errors and solutions are shown on the ""cover"".

*Scenario 3: No backend validation errors*
*Given* the user has submitted a Vinyl 16b or 24b asset registration request,
*When* all secondary (backend) validation checks pass,
*Then* no red error button should appear on the master screen.

*Scenario 4: Real-time update*
*Given* the user has submitted a Vinyl 16b or 24b asset registration request,
*When* the backend validation completes,
*Then* the system should automatically update the UI (master screen) with the error button if applicable,
*And* this should occur without requiring a manual browser refresh or navigation.

As a user registering a DBKS asset,
I want the system to automatically display a red error button on the master if any backend validation fails,
So that I can quickly see what went wrong and how to fix it without needing to refresh the browser.

*Acceptance Criteria*
*Scenario 1: Backend validation fails*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* one or more secondary (backend) validation checks fail,
*Then* the system should automatically display a red error button on the top-right corner of the master screen,
*And* this should happen in real time without requiring the user to refresh the browser.

*Scenario 2:* Error button click opens error details
*Given* a red error button is displayed on the top-right corner of the master screen,
*When* the user clicks on the red error button,
*Then* a pop-up window should appear,
*And* the pop-up should display all validation errors in red text,
*And* the corresponding solutions or recommendations should be displayed in blue text,
*And* the format and style should be consistent with how errors and solutions are shown on the ""cover"".

*Scenario 3: No backend validation errors*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* all secondary (backend) validation checks pass,
*Then* no red error button should appear on the master screen.

*Scenario 4: Real-time update*
*Given* the user has submitted a DBKS asset registration request,
*When* the backend validation completes,
*Then* the system should automatically update the UI (master screen) with the error button if applicable,
*And* this should occur without requiring a manual browser refresh or navigation.

*Given* the user has submitted a DVD DDP asset registration request,
*When* the backend validation completes,
*Then* the system should automatically update the UI (master screen) with the error button if applicable,
*And* this should occur without requiring a manual browser refresh or navigation.

*Given* a user has opened a DBKS product,

*And* the product asset has a registration status of ""Failed"",

*When* the user clicks on the ""x"" (delete) button on the left side of the asset,

*Then* the system should not display the ""Reason for Delete"" pop-up window,

*And* the system should immediately delete the asset from the view.

 

*AC2: Behavior Remains Unchanged for Other Statuses*

*Given* a user is viewing a DBKS product with an asset not in ""Failed"" status (e.g., ""In Progress"", ""Pending"", ""Completed"", etc.),

*When* the user clicks on the ""x"" button,

*Then* the system should display the ""Reason for Delete"" pop-up window as usual.

 

*AC3: UI Feedback Upon Deletion*

*Given* an asset in ""Failed"" status is deleted via the ""x"" button,

*When* the deletion is successful,

The logic around ClosedCaptionMaster for asset swap is incorrect. We need to only clear the specific language for the old asset not the new one.

As a user uploading an image,
I want the system to validate DPI/PPI at both UI and backend levels,
So that only compliant images (≥72 DPI/PPI) are accepted.

*Acceptance Criteria*
*AC1 - Successful Upload with Valid DPI/PPI(Manual Workflow)*
*Given* the user uploads an image
*And* the UI can read the DPI/PPI
*And* the DPI/PPI is ≥ 72
*When* the user submits the image
*Then* the UI passes the preflight check
*And* the asset is sent to the backend
*And* the backend confirms DPI/PPI is ≥ 72
*Then* the asset is registered successfully

*AC2 - UI Fails Preflight Check (DPI/PPI < 72)*
*Given* the user uploads an image
*And* the UI can read the DPI/PPI
*And* the DPI/PPI is < 72
*Then* the UI blocks submission
*And* displays a DPI/PPI error to the user

*AC3 - UI Cannot Read DPI/PPI*
*Given* the user uploads an image
*And* the UI cannot read the DPI/PPI
*Then* the UI shows a warning, ({*}Warning message:{*} Cover asset must be a minimum 72dpi, the header data of the submitted file is missing this data.)
*And* allows the user to submit the asset

*When* the backend receives the image
*And* the backend reads DPI/PPI ≥ 72
*Then* the asset is registered successfully

*When* the backend reads DPI/PPI and if it is < 72
*Then* the backend rejects the asset

*When* the backend cannot read DPI/PPI
*Then* registration fails with status “Validation Error”{*}(NEED TO CONFIRM WITH MATT) - Before the validation error it goes through Archive In Progress status include that in the AC.{*}
*And* UI shows a red error button
*And* clicking the button shows a popup with the following:
    - Error details
    - Option to Auto Correct(Button)
    - Option to Swap Asset(Button)

*AC4 - Manual Auto-Correct Flow*
*Given* the backend fails registration with Validation Error
*And* the user clicks “Auto Correct” in the error popup
*Then* the backend sets DPI/PPI to 72
*And* stores both original and corrected assets
*And* registers the corrected asset
*And* sends an email to the uploader with:{*}(Update this with the below comments from refinement){*}
    - The corrected asset
    - Notification that the asset was renamed
*Then* the UI displays the corrected asset
*And*  shows an indicator it was auto-corrected on the right side of the asset as displayed on SFV

*AC5 - Asset Swap Flow*
*Given* the user clicks “Swap Asset” in the error popup
*Then* the user is prompted to upload a new image
*And* the validation workflow (UI + backend) is repeated from AC1

*AC6 - Auto-Correct workflow (Permission: UST_AUTOMATED_AUTOCORRECTION)*
*Given* the UI and backend cannot read the DPI/PPI
*And* the user has the permission UST_AUTOMATED_AUTOCORRECTION
*Then* the backend marks the old asset as “Archive In Progress”
*And* UI reflects the same

*When* the user refreshes the page
*Then* UI shows new status as “Auto Correction In Progress”

*Then* the backend auto-corrects the image
*And* sets DPI/PPI to 72
*And* registers the corrected image
*And* sends an email to the uploader

*And*  shows an indicator it was auto-corrected on the right side of the asset as displayed on SFV

 

*AC7 - Email Notification for Auto-Corrected Asset*
*Given* an image is auto-corrected
*When* correction is completed
*Then* an email is sent to the uploader
*And* includes:
    - The corrected asset
    - Message that the asset was renamed

*AC8 - UI Indicator for Auto-Corrected Assets*
*Given* an image is auto-corrected (manually or automatically)
Then the UI should display an icon indicating auto-correction

Notes:

Created a separate ticket for download.

Need to add the email template for the notification on this ticket (Mohammed)

+List of email notifications:+

Non Auto system autocorrect:

Once reg fails before auto correct

Once submitted for auto correct - Should we have a notification for this ?

Post auto correct - Can combine it with Registration successful email ?

 

Auto system auto correct:

When asset goes through auto correct.

Post auto correct - Can combine it with Registration successful email ?

 

 

Notes from refinement 9/3 & 9/4: 

Note: If the autocorrect fails it should not be going on a loop for auto correction

+List of email notifications:+

Non Auto system autocorrect:

Once reg fails(Validation error status) before auto correct -Let user know with a message that the user should click on the autocorrect button.

-Once submitted for auto correct - Should we have a notification for this ?-

Post auto correct & Failure - Can combine it with Registration successful email ? - This should be good. (Failure case - AMP is down) - Need to have a scenario for failure (This case can be ignored for testing - FAILURE) 

 

Auto system auto correct:

-When asset goes through auto correct.-

Post auto correct/Failure - Can combine it with Registration successful email ? - This is good

 

Reg. job name - currently it shows the system generated name, 

Update the story with the file resaved name - FILENAME_AUTOCORRECT/AUTOCORRECTED.jpeg - Check with GMP on the case sensitive & the name itself AUTOCORRECT/AUTOCORRECTED  - UST & Reg job will show the new name.

Change the ARCHIVE IN PROGRESS to *TO BE ARCHIVED*

As a user,
I want the UST to hide any master type under a stereo product that has a virtual master linked to it,
So that I only see relevant master types without linked virtual masters.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* a stereo product is loaded on UST,
*WHEN* there are master types linked to a virtual master,
*THEN* those specific master types should not be displayed under the stereo audio section.

*User Story 2:* Display Master Type After Unlinking Virtual Master

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* a master type is currently hidden due to a linked virtual master,
*WHEN* the user unlinks the virtual master from that master type,
*THEN* the master type should become visible under the stereo audio section.

Fix Issues on Media Batch Converter Status and Export Details Pages,UST-2697,1987567,,User Story,To Do,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,,ganu001,wang042,wang042,01/Oct/25 6:01 PM,08/Oct/25 3:55 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,,,AOMA-2.115.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+

We need to fix several issues related to the Media Batch Converter Status Page and Export Details Page:

*1. Status Page default data range (no flicker issue)*
When a user with MBC View permission lands on the Media Batch Converter Job Status Page, the view should by default only display the last two days of records (Date Range applied).

Currently, the page briefly flashes all Export Job Status records before reverting to the 2-day filter. This flicker should be fixed. The page must directly load showing only the last two days of records, without displaying all jobs even momentarily. Users should see all records only after they check “Ignore Data Range” and apply the filter.

*2. Missing ""Back to List"" Button:*
On the AOMA3 Export Status Page, when users click on an Job ID, there should be a Back to List button available. This button was unintentionally removed in the last build and needs to be restored.

*3. Batch Export Details page for Sony CI Imports:*
When users navigate to the Batch Export Details Page for a batch that was initiated via Select Files - Import from Sony CI, the Batch Information table should display the same format as Select Files - Upload from Local, including showing the AMP Asset Key.

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+

*1. Given* the user with MBC View/View All permission navigates to the Media Batch Converter Job Status Page
*When* the page loads
*Then* it should immediately show only the last two days of records by default, without flashing all records first.

*2. Given* the user checks “Ignore Data Range” and applies the filter
*When* the filter is applied
*Then* the page displays all available Export Job Status records.

*3. Given* the user clicks on an Job ID to open the AOMA 3 Export Details page,

*When* the page loads,
*Then* a ""Back to List"" button should be visible and functional.

*Description*
Please provide a few isrc_ids that return more than one product when using the query below in the stage environment.

We have observed that some ISRCs are returning multiple products, and upon investigation, the duplicate products are not coming from RAAS. I need a similar set of ISRCs in stage to help test and validate that the recent code changes are handling such cases correctly.

Here's another backfill that we need in dev, stage and prod.

For VSC, Closed Caption and Subtitles, for all registered assets, we want to backfill ISRCs on track masters by inheriting from first existing linked product track. 

This can be done anytime in December so no rush.

Hi  ,

 
 # Missing records in  product_track_links : We found most of the Subtitle masters which are linked to product and data do not present in ProductTrackLinks table

 

Few examples of this case :

 # Missing records in  video_track_masters : we found huge counts of missing records..  below are some of the examples for each category .

For VSC : we see first inset happened around : 2022-10-25 22:53:14.737  ,  

 

So could you please confirm if the code fix moved around that time to production ? if so , then not sure why we are seeing this issue for some subtitle and closed captions masters -  

[~PALA017]  [~SPAG001]   - Can we sort this before we start working on this backfill ?

TTTML and subtitle we noticed a bug with the assetSwap case and will be pushing a fix for this in the 12/06 build.

Subtitles we need to have a internal discussion on the architecture as currently it can not support product_track_links due to the structure of them.

Phase 1: Move two existing submenu items from *Engineering -- QC Metadata* out to top-level items directly under Engineering:
• Package Printing Specifications
• Video Metadata


Behavior for both must be identical to launching them from QC Metadata today (same pages, same feature capabilities), and must remain controlled by the same permissions.


Phase 2 : Once the two items function as top-level Engineering menu entries, retire the QC Metadata module entirely:
• Remove QC Metadata from the Engineering menu (DB change).
• Perform code cleanup

*As a* user with the appropriate permissions, 

*I want* Package Printing Specifications and Video Metadata accessible directly under the Engineering menu 

*so that* I can reach them faster, while retiring the obsolete QC Metadata section to reduce confusion.

AC1: Top-level menu entries appear
*Given* I have a permission that grants me access to Package Printing Specifications or Video Metadat
*When* I open the Engineering menu
*Then* I see Package Printing Specifications and Video Metadata as separate top-level entries under Engineering.

AC2 — Same functionality
*Given* I launch either Package Printing Specifications or Video Metadata from the Engineering menu entries
*When* the page loads
*Then* the feature set, page layout, available actions are identical to the prior behavior when launched from QC Metadata.

AC3 — Permissions unchanged
*Given* my account lacks the permission that previously restricted access to one or both features
*When* I open the Engineering menu or attempt to navigate directly via URL
*Then* menu entries should be hidden and  direct URL access denied with the same error",,wang042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMSE-1564,,,,,,,,,,"30/Sep/25 3:49 PM;wang042;QC Metadata.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2699385/QC+Metadata.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3sb2f:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We would like to explore and build workflows to auto-correct these issues to be implemented into the AOMA registration workflow. 

User submits asset, asset fails validation, user has an option to select auto-correct for the system to attempt to correct the issue. - AOMA needs to come up with a solution for this

Note: we also need to cover the use case where no header data is available in this scenario we need to auto correct as well, We need to explore this option using the Tiffany tool which Matt.C had developed if there are any other approach please update it here.

Also this is dependent on the imagemagick version upgrade.

There is a bug that pops up where a user somehow triggers an additional master to be created on UST upload. It seems like one of the ways this is possible is if the side/sequence values are not being correctly provided on the savePackage call. We should add a safety check here to prevent this issue.

In the MBC interface, when users choose to “Select Files” for batch export, they must first select one of the three radio buttons: Audio, Video, or Graphics. Based on the selected option, the system should only allow files of the corresponding type to be uploaded—regardless of whether they are imported via Sony CI or uploaded from Local Upload. If users attempt to upload a file of an incorrect type (e.g. uploading a Video file while Audio is selected), the system should block the upload and display an error notification popup in the top-right corner.

Currently, when a user submits a Media Batch Converter job, a pop-up window appears displaying the generated Batch ID. However, this Batch ID is not clickable, requiring users to manually navigate to the Export Status UI and enter the Batch ID to check the status. To improve usability,  the Batch ID should be clickable, and clicking it should redirect the user to the Export Status UI, where the Batch ID filter is already applied, displaying only the relevant batch details.

Currently users have two options to upload files:

1. Assets from AOMA – allows selection of assets directly from the AOMA system

2. Select Files(s) – allows upload of files from the local device

Currently, after submission:

• The *Assets from AOMA* option displays *a single toast message* showing the Batch ID upon successful submission.

• The *Select Files* option displays *multiple toast messages — one for each individual file in the batch.*

This inconsistent behavior can confuse users. To improve the user experience, the toast message behavior for the Select File(s) option should be updated to match the Assets from AOMA  — to display a single toast message indicating the batch has been submitted along with the Batch ID.

+*User Story:*+

*As a* user,
*I want* the Batch ID displayed in the Media Batch Converter submission pop-up to be clickable,
*So that* I can quickly access the Export Status UI with the Batch ID pre-filtered, avoiding the need for manual input.

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+

*1. Given* a user submits a batch using the Media Batch Converter,
*When* the submission is completed,
*Then* a pop-up window should display the generated Batch ID, and the Batch ID should be clickable.

*2. Given* a user sees the pop-up window with the Batch ID,
*When* the user clicks on the Batch ID,

*Then* the system should redirect the user to the MBC Job Status UI,
        *And* the Batch ID filter should be automatically applied,
        *And* the filtered results should display only the details related to the selected Batch ID.

*3. Given* a user is redirected to the MBC Job Status UI,
*When* the page loads,
*Then* the page should be pre-filtered with the Batch ID from the pop-up,
        *And* the MBC job batch details should be correctly displayed based on the applied filter. ",,ganu001,wang042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2619,,,,,,,,,,"11/Mar/25 10:27 PM;wang042;image-2025-03-11-17-27-45-176.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2427791/image-2025-03-11-17-27-45-176.png","23/Apr/25 4:12 AM;ganu001;image-2025-04-22-22-12-42-054.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2492960/image-2025-04-22-22-12-42-054.png","23/Apr/25 4:13 AM;ganu001;image-2025-04-22-22-13-24-278.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2492961/image-2025-04-22-22-13-24-278.png","23/Apr/25 4:12 AM;ganu001;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2492959/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i37hn3:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S08,DSC_2025_S09,DSC_2025_S10,DSC_2025_S11,DSC_2025_S12,DSC_2025_S13,DSC_2025_S14,DSC_2025_S15,DSC_2025_S16,DSC_2025_S17,DSC_2025_S18,DSC_2025_S19,DSC_2025_S20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,develop,,,,,,,,,true,"23/Apr/25 4:12 AM;ganu001;!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

Cover has some weird UST interactions due to its initial design being hybrid with legacy in terms of registration jobs. It would always required a new arJob to be created on an upload where as other masters will re-use jobs unless the master is purged. Asset Swap seems to also be bugged where we new job and dont clear the old job when he swap completes. DBKS which was designed like UST has also inherited some of these issues.

*AC:*
 * We should fix cover/dbks to behave more like the other masters where we only create new job when the old one is purged 
 ** Purged will generally occur when the last asset is fully unregistered
 * AssetSwap should use the existing job instead of creating a new job

Currently UST maintains a list of product configurations and what display mapping they should have. This however means we need to update these lists as we add new masterTypes.

Instead we should purely be taking the supported masterTypes from those product configs and deciding the displays that should show up from that list. 

*Dev Notes:*
 * We will probally still hide stereo sections from mixed media configs until we handle load better. Should test how this behaves before blocking through
 ** Concern is configs that have side 1 video and side 2 audio. UST was not designed well around these configs

When a wav 24 is uploaded we allow a user to downconvert the master for a wav 16 registration. When doing this as part of the full master option however there is a chance that two of wav 24 masters finish at the same exact time, which can cause an issue with the db creation for some of the entries as both try to create the same entry. 

We need to modify where the wav 16 parent master information is created for full master workflows. If the downconvert flag is true in for a full master and at least one of the wav 24 master is valid, we can create the wav 16 master basic information as part of that process.

Once registered when we click on the QC notes button it again brings up the mastering engineer pop up and we need to select an email and save it before we get into the QC Notes - Need to check why cant the 1st time when we select the mastering engineer be saved and why should we bring it up on the QC notes as well.

[UI] Remove duration mismatch QC Lock message for 360 RA masters,UST-1303,1382939,,User Story,Dev Testing,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,,hale002,samu006,samu006,21/Feb/23 5:27 PM,29/Sep/25 8:30 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,,,,,,0,,"*User story:* When QC Notes are locked for immersive masters, there are messages that show when there are mismatches between conflicting durations and ISRC's, from GRPS/label copy and from saved track master data. Currently for 360 RA masters, since they have a different folder structure compared to other masters, and because they have not migrated to Cloud, there are no duration mismatches to capture and display to the user. As such, the duration mismatch message needs to stop displaying to the user.

*Pre-conditions:*

-User is on UST and is uploading/registering *360 RA assets*

-User is trying to lock QC Notes from UST interface

*Acceptance Criteria:*

-The duration mismatch message should be removed for *360 RA assets ONLY* when locking QC Notes, due to durations being unable to be captured.

-Discuss if the duration mismatch should also no longer show on the column? (This is an outstanding question)

We have replaced immersiveAudioDto which was previously just used for the immersive audios with the more generic dto for all audios named audioMasterDto.

We want to add a new column to ust_event_email_tracking named ust_event_type. This new column will keep track of what type of email UST is sending out. This requires no backfill since existing entries are already processed so any process entries can be left null (also we should allow null so we don't need to backfill).

With this new column  can we also create the corresponding enum db table for the following ust_event_types

We are currently working on some enhancements for the automated qc notes error messages we generate for the users. We want to add a warning/error status, an enhanced warning/error message and a suggested corrective action message. 

As such can we add the follow three columns (names we can change though):
 * Validation Status (not in love with the name)
 ** This field would need to contain the following statuses:
 *** Fail, with warning
 *** Pass, with warning,
 *** Pass
 ** We can either have a separate enum table for the above statuses or this can be a text field
 * Validation Message 
 ** Text field 
 ** {*}Ex message{*}: The file submitted appears to be created from a lower fidelity source. Frequency content only extends to %% while Aoma expects 22.05kHz from a 44.1kHz file. 
 * Validation Corrective Action

As a user, I want to upload a file and have the preflight analyze the framerate so that I can quickly determine if the file meets compliance standards.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I have selected a file for registration,
*WHEN* the system performs a preflight analysis on the framerate,
*THEN* if the framerate is valid (23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, or 30fps), a green circle with a green tick mark should be displayed with the message “The framerate has passed.”

*User Story2:* Indicate Non-Compliance with Framerate
As a user, I want to be notified when the framerate of my uploaded file is not compliant so that I can make necessary corrections before submission.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I have uploaded a file,
*WHEN* the system detects that the framerate does not meet compliance,
*THEN* a red circle with a red exclamatory mark should be displayed with the message “The framerate of this asset, %%, does not meet compliance. Accepted framerates are 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30fps.” and the submit button should be greyed out.
*AND* the suggested corrective action message “Please correct and resubmit. Compliance guidelines can be found here: [https://mediaguide.sonymusic.com/graphics/cover-art/]” should be shown.

*User Story3:* Indicate Unreadable Framerate
As a user, I want to be informed when the system cannot read the framerate from the file header so that I can take appropriate action to rectify the issue.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I have uploaded a file,
*WHEN* the system cannot read the framerate from the header data,
*THEN* a yellow circle with a yellow exclamatory mark should be displayed with the message “The Value for framerate is not readable from the header data of the submitted file.”

We need to implement a new page called Media Batch Converter Job Status Page. This page will display the export status of all batch exports initiated via MBC, whether they were triggered through {*}Product Lookup or Select Files{*}.

The page will follow a List View format and display one row per batch, along with export-related details.

!MBC Batch Export Status page 4.0.png|width=1223,height=702!

*For Product Lookup*

!image-2025-09-12-17-13-31-868.png|width=515,height=270!

*For Select Files*

!image-2025-09-12-17-15-07-270.png|width=533,height=246!

 

*For Product Lookup-based batch exports:*

Each row represents one product within the batch. For example, if Batch ID 1089 includes 4 products, there will be 4 entries (rows) with the same Batch ID but different Product Numbers.

*For Select Files-based batch exports:*

Since there’s no associated Product Number, the Product Number column will show “N/A”.

*The columns displayed in the table are:*
• Batch ID
• Batch Name (with ellipsis-style expandable popup for long names)
• Batch Type
• Username (with info icon to reveal full email)
• Batch Start Date
• Batch End Date
• Destination (with info icon showing workspace and network)
• Priority
• Status (with info icon showing per-track export status for Product Lookup, or per-file status for Select Files)

*Filters available on the page:*
• Username
• Batch ID
• Batch Name
• From Date, To Date
• Status
• Batch Type

+*User Story*+
*As a* user of Media BatchConverter,
*I want*  to view a status page that lists all my export batches,
*So that* I can track the export status of each batch and access detailed information quickly via clickable batch id

Currently UST always updates the registrationJob status to the last action that occurs on a master. For example if you register two tracks back to back and the second one fails the job would be failed despite there being one registered asset. This can lead to confusion with users or also causes issues with how kafka team is processing messaging as they use the jobStatus for certain workflows. As such we have decided revamp how UST interacts with the job status in a couple of manners.

 

*Proposed Changes:*

*Introduce a new partially registration flag for the job status:*

We want to introduce a flag called partially registered to handle cases where we have successfully registered uploads and some manner of failed upload. This will allow UST to keep user's informed that their jobs need to be reviewed and kafka team can treat this as the same as registered successfully since some assets went through.

In order to support this UST would need to make the following changes
 * Whenever a job has a failure we check if there are registered assets tied to the assetSubmission. If there are instead of failing the job we update the job successful and set the partial registration flag 
 * Whenever we clear any failed jobs we need to recheck the job status. If we cleared the last failed upload then the status should be updated to registration successful
 ** Cancel should not be considered a failed status so should not impact status
 * If no assets are registered the job status will behave as is currently is
 * We should do a sanity test of one of these jobs in legacy (mainly export)

 

*Clean up certain UST workflows:*
 * Cancel currently doesn't reset the job status so should be adjust with the above logic
 * Un-registration should also take into consideration the above logic

 

*QA Testing:*
 # Test multi track workflows with these two baselines
 ## One valid register file tied to the master
 ## No registered file tied to the master
 # Single track uploads for sanity
 ## Should also try auto-correct workflow and assetSwap

*QA Notes:*
 * Please note cover behaves a little different then the existing masters which we will try to get more in sync for the future

*Dev Notes:*

We need a future ticket to display this flag on registration job page
Kafka team will need a ticket when this is picked up to make changes on their end.",,gvamsik,hale002,jpitzer,roraj01,spag001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMSE-1379,,,,,,,,,DPSA-31034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3bdn3:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S10,DSC_2025_S11,DSC_2025_S12,DSC_2025_S13,DSC_2025_S14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,feature_UST-2459_ArJob_Partial_Registration,release,develop,hotfix-TestVinyl,master,,,,,true,"25/Jun/25 6:03 PM;spag001;As per discussion with the other teams, we have decided to do this via flag in the assetRegistrationJobs table instead of a new status to lower the amount of changes.;;;","14/Jul/25 6:22 PM;spag001;*Testing 1A - Multi track where there is a registered file tied to the master :*

Currently UST always updates the registrationJob status to the last action that occurs on a master. For example if you register two tracks back to back and the second one fails the job would be failed despite there being one registered asset. This can lead to confusion with users or also causes issues with how kafka team is processing messaging as they use the jobStatus for certain workflows. As such we have decided revamp how UST interacts with the job status in a couple of manners.

 

*Proposed Changes:*

*Introduce a new partially registration flag for the job status:*

We want to introduce a flag called partially registered to handle cases where we have successfully registered uploads and some manner of failed upload. This will allow UST to keep user's informed that their jobs need to be reviewed and kafka team can treat this as the same as registered successfully since some assets went through.

In order to support this UST would need to make the following changes
 * Whenever a job has a failure we check if there are registered assets tied to the assetSubmission. If there are instead of failing the job we update the job successful and set the partial registration flag 
 * Whenever we clear any failed jobs we need to recheck the job status. If we cleared the last failed upload then the status should be updated to registration successful
 ** Cancel should not be considered a failed status so should not impact status
 * If no assets are registered the job status will behave as is currently is
 * We should do a sanity test of one of these jobs in legacy (mainly export)

 

*Clean up certain UST workflows:*
 * Cancel currently doesn't reset the job status so should be adjust with the above logic
 * Un-registration should also take into consideration the above logic

*QA Testing:*
 # Test multi track workflows with these two baselines
 ## One valid register file tied to the master
 ## No registered file tied to the master
 # Single track uploads for sanity
 ## Should also try auto-correct workflow and assetSwap

*QA Notes:*
 * Please note cover behaves a little different then the existing masters which we will try to get more in sync for the future

*Dev Notes:*

We need a future ticket to display this flag on registration job page
Kafka team will need a ticket when this is picked up to make changes on their end.

Currently, when using MBC to pull stereo audio assets via ISRC lookup, the system retrieves assets not only from the GRAS system but also from legacy GAS system. This results in duplicate or redundant audio files being returned for a single ISRC.

We need to ensure that ISRC lookups only retrieve assets from GRAS and exclude any results from the GAS system.

+*User Story*+

*As a* MBC user,
*I want* ISRC lookups in MBC to only return assets from GRAS,
*So that* I can avoid duplicate results

+*Acceptance Criteria*+

*Given* a user performs an ISRC lookup in MBC
*When* the system queries for audio assets
*Then* only assets from GRAS should be returned
    *And* no assets from the legacy GAS system should appear in the results

Nelson's wireframe for details pages is in Attachments.

 

*Pre-conditions:*

User has AOMA3 EXPORT or AOMA3 EXPORT UNAPPROVED MASTER permission

User is on UST

_Exclude Vinyl masters as this is on a different ticket, and implementation may be different:_ AOMA3-2771

*Acceptance Criteria:*

[~hale002]{color:#de350b} *modify the AC's here so that it more accurately represents UST flow. Test cases should also be modified based on what masters are currently supported.*{color}

AND user has selected a master from Associated Masters section
AND user has execute access on at least one of master's security group
AND master has at least one file available for download ({_}UI to use assetAvailability flag here{_})
THEN display ""Download All (.zip)"" and ""Download Selected (.zip)"" buttons in dark gray header, next to master ID, with cloud icon
 * Nelson was thinking that the buttons should be uniform with the single cloud icon, but I'll let UI team determine what they think is better
 * !image-2025-06-09-09-51-31-964.png|width=595,height=78!

 

WHEN master is unapproved
AND user has permission AOMA3 EXPORT UNAPPROVED MASTER
AND user has selected a master from Associated Masters section
AND user has execute access on at least one of master's security group
AND master has at least one file available for download ({_}UI to use assetAvailability flag here{_})
THEN display ""Download All (.zip)"" and ""Download Selected (.zip)"" buttons in dark gray header, next to master ID, with cloud icon

 

WHEN user clicks ""Download All""
THEN all master's listed files should be downloaded in a single .zip folder
 * *{color:#de350b}User should not need to check any box for this{color}*

 

WHEN user checks any number of folder, or file, or component(s)
AND user clicks ""Download Selected""
THEN download selected files in a single .zip folder
 * Is it possible to have logic where clicking any of the download icons and buttons will just download selected files? That way user won't have to scroll for a 100+ track product. See below screenshot and bottom suggestion by Nelson
 * !image-2025-06-09-09-53-07-493.png|width=577,height=293!
 * Button should be grayed out until a file, component or folder is selected
 * In order for this to work for PKGFs, we'll need to add checkboxes on each Component, folder and file in the Associated Masters section. Discuss this

 

Do we keep the modal for Long/Short Name and Reason from single file download (disregard 'i' icons/previews)?
 * +*For UI:*+ The naming options are not applicable for PKGFs, for now...so you can exclude the options on modal when its PKGF. For QAs/Jack, when the test is run here for PKGFs, only the reason entry is expected to show.
 * +*For BE:*+ Should we implement naming convention before the zipping? If so, it should be the same as Export. I suppose since this is Full Master as opposed to track, we should shorten it somewhat. Current Export file-naming scheme is in Attachments as an Excel

!image-2025-03-26-14-33-41-664.png!

 

There will be a single event for a whole master download in Master Event History (in the desc, indicate this is a ""full master download"")
 * Whether it is a single file or a full master, the event history should have one entry for each asset
 * Event type should be HTTP Download, as previous downloads are
 * Like for LFV and AMB ""sub-types"", implement the same on PKGF master (has PDFs, labels, docs, zip text docs, etc, all with different master IDs)

 

Single email notification to be sent (track master information needed in the email can be called from the table that PKGF notification email uses. As this is coming from the Associated Masters section, product information should also be there)
 * For full master download email, there is also a certain table in UST which has information; this table can be used in the email to display the tracks

 

*Test cases:*
 # PKGF (One of 2 most important cases, as this will help to reduce A2 DMD traffic)
 # WAV (The other of the 2, to reduce A2 digital Export traffic. Verify file-naming mimics MASTER-centric Export to Ci/DMD/MAF, when long Option chosen)
 # Cover (A 3rd most important case, to reduce A2 digital Export traffic. Verify file-naming mimics MASTER-centric Export to Ci/DMD/MAF, when long Option chosen)
 # Atmos
 # SFV (verify file-naming mimics MASTER-centric Export to Ci/DMD/MAF, when long Option chosen)

{*}Description{*}: With the newest build we are seeing all the categories within the descriptor file display in the Differences tab, and we'd only like to see the categories in which we have a comparison between the Source and the Autocorrect

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Given the user is looking at the SFV Descriptor File from the UST

When they are on the ""Differences"" tab of the file

Then all data that compares the Source and the Autocorrected information for the asset will display

And all the criteria that do not have both Source and Autocorrected information for will not display on the differences tab

And the name of the category for all Categories (the header, as shown in yellow) will show even when none of its criteria has a comparison available

And the Category will be expandable/collapsible when there are criteria data available for it

And the Category will not be expandable when there is no criteria data available for it

 * AMP has a way of receiving assets for registrations. They also support metadata with json key-value pair.
 * Once AMP receives a registration request, they create amp-asset-key and using UST graphQL endpoints, submit asset for UST registration
 * To add SMEJ SFV UST registration support, we need to define all QC metadata and Jira ticket creation details via key value pair XML. and then UST graphQL should support accepting that metadata along with asset for registration.
 * We also need to support productized registration as currently, AMP supports master only registration.

 * DPI/PPI

We would like to explore and build workflows to auto-correct these issues to be implemented into the AOMA registration workflow. 

User submits asset, asset fails validation, user has an option to select auto-correct for the system to attempt to correct the issue. - AOMA needs to come up with a solution for this

Note: we also need to cover the use case where no header data is available in this scenario we need to auto correct as well, We need to explore this option using the Tiffany tool which Matt.C had developed if there are any other approach please update it here.

Also this is dependent on the imagemagick version upgrade.

"Ensure ""Select Audio Sources"" in MBC Exports the Highest-Priority Format When No/All/multiple Selection is Made",UST-2605,1945546,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,21/Jul/25 8:48 PM,27/Aug/25 9:34 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,15/Aug/25 6:38 PM,,AOMA-2.113.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+
In the Media Batch Converter (MBC) tool, when exporting audio products, there is a section called ""Select Audio Sources"" that has multiple format options, including:
• WAV 24bit Track Master 192kHz
• WAV 24bit Track Master 176.4kHz
• WAV 24bit Track Master 96kHz
• WAV 24bit Track Master 88.2kHz
• WAV 24bit Track Master 48kHz
• WAV 24bit Track Master 44.1kHz
• WAV 16bit Track Master
• DDP Track Master

If the user does not make any selection in this section or selects all, the export behavior should be the same logic. That is, *the system should automatically look into the product and determine which of the above formats are available for each track.*

{*}The system should then export one format per track, following a strict priority order from highest to lowest{*}. For example, if both ""WAV 16bit TrackMaster"" and ""DDP TrackMaster"" are available for the same track, the system should choose the higher-priority ""WAV 16bit TrackMaster.""

This ticket ensures that default ( full-selection ) behavior in ""Select Audio Sources"" always results in the highest available audio format being exported per track, based on the priority order above.

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+
*1. Given* a user does *not select any* options under ""Select Audio Sources,""

*Then* the system should export the highest-priority available format per track from the defined list.
*2. Given* a user *selects all options* under ""Select Audio Sources,""
*When* they export an audio product,
*Then* the behavior should be identical to making no selection, the system should still export the highest-priority available format per track.

*3. Given* a user *selects multiple (not all)* *options* under ""Select Audio Sources,""

*When* they export an audio product,
*Then* the system should still export the *highest-priority available format* per track.
*4. Given* a product contains multiple available formats for the same track (e.g. both WAV 16bit Track Master and DDP Track Master),
*When* the export is triggered with either no selection or multiple selected,

Due to how the way .contains works, if a value is null it can not be used to compare into an unmutable list. We should update the places we are doing this in the SFV validations to handle this correctly.

 

*Dev Notes:*

Example from the DPSA is validateFormatProfile function in assetValidationService. The below code will fail if attributeValue is null. We should verify other places don't also have this issue.

Fix for MBC Submit Button Incorrectly Disabled After Closing “Select Destinations” Without Changes,UST-2606,1945552,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,21/Jul/25 8:58 PM,27/Aug/25 4:48 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,20/Aug/25 5:05 PM,,AOMA-2.113.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+
There is currently a bug in the MBC. After a user selects files to export via the *“Select Files”* section and then proceeds to the *“Select Destinations”* section:
1. If the user fills in all mandatory fields with valid input and clicks “Apply”, the Submit button becomes enabled — this is correct.
2. However, if the user does not click Submit at this point and instead *reopens the “Select Destinations” section* just to review the entered information *(without making any changes),* and then closes the section by *clicking the “X” (close icon)* rather than clicking Apply, the Submit button becomes disabled.
3. This is incorrect behavior. The Submit button should remain enabled as long as:
• Valid destination info has already been saved.
• The user has not cleared or invalidated any mandatory inputs.

We sometimes have been hitting an issue when registering wavs in bulk (folder upload) where the jobs finish too close together and we hit a deadlock issue. We are thinking about moving the job update logic to the event based email polling logic where the different tracks meet back up to avoid this type of issue.

 

*AC:*

For multi track (DSD, wav, immersives) based upload workflows the successful registration status will be updated to complete at the same time the email registration is sent out.

 

*QA Notes:*

Failures will still update the job status immediately but successful registrations will wait for them all to finish.

Please also test un-registration with the workflows. Unregister the last asset tied to a master and mess around with it. ",,jpitzer,spag001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DPSA-31179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3kauf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S14,DSC_2025_S15,DSC_2025_S16,DSC_2025_S17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,feature_UST-2583_DeadLock_Job_Fix,release,develop,hotfix-TestVinyl,master,,,,,true,"31/Jul/25 9:36 PM;spag001;*Sanity Testing:*

As a {*}user{*},
I want to receive a warning message when I attempt an asset swap on a fully published product with a past GRPS release date,
So that I am aware that the new asset will be automatically registered and delivered to partners.

*Acceptance Criteria*

*Scenario 1: Fully published product with past GRPS release date*
 *Given* a product has a publish status of _Fully Published_
 *And* the GRPS release date is a past date
 *When* the user attempts an asset swap
 *Then* a warning pop-up should appear with the message:
_“This action will register the new asset to a released & full published product and will be delivered to the partners automatically.”_

*Scenario 2: Fully published product with past GRPS release date linked to another product*
 *Given* a product (Product A) has a publish status of _Fully Published_
 *And* the GRPS release date is a past date
 *And* Product A is linked to Product B
 *When* the user attempts an asset swap on Product A
 *Then* a warning pop-up should appear with the message:
_“This action will register the new asset to a released & full published product and will be delivered to the partners automatically.”_

*Scenario 3: Both linked products fully published with past GRPS release date*
*Given* a product (Product A) has a publish status of _Fully Published_
*And* the GRPS release date is a past date
*And* Product A is linked to Product B
*And* Product B is also _Fully Published_
*When* the user attempts an asset swap on Product A
*Then* a warning pop-up should appear with the message:
_“This action will register the new asset to a released & full published product and will be delivered to the partners automatically.”_

 

*Note:*

Please refer to Full ""Publish Warning Message"" spreadsheet attached to this ticket for usecases.

 

 

*Notes from refinement call on 6/17/2025:*

h4. *Action Items from 6/17:*
 * *Warning Message Consistency:* Invite Rithwik to the call to ensure consistency in warning messages across both sides(Linking & Reg.).

 * *Warning Message Implementation:* Discuss and finalize the rules for warning messages with the EOM team, including whether to check the release date, published status, or both. (Mohammed)

 * *QC Notes Validation:* Discuss internally and with Mike the validation rules for QC notes, especially for linking and registration of assets to published products. (Rohit did this on the same call)

 * *Immersive Asset Linking:* Discuss and decide on the handling of immersive asset linking, including the consideration of QC notes lock and immersive release date. (Rohit, Mohammed)

 * *Follow-up Meeting:* Schedule another meeting to specifically discuss the immersive registration to stereo product project. (Mohammed)

 * *Follow-up Meeting:* Schedule another call just to discuss this ticket specifically.(Mohammed)

 
h4. {*}Key Topics{*}{*}from 6/17{*}{*}:{*}
 * *Warning Message for Asset Swap:* Mohammed and Rohit discussed the need for a warning message when an asset is swapped in a fully published product. This warning is to ensure that the swapped asset is not released without proper QC, as it is currently happening without any warning.

 * *Consistency in Warning Messages:* Rohit emphasized the importance of keeping the warning messages consistent across both sides of the system. He suggested inviting Rithwik to the call to ensure consistency in the implementation of the warning messages.

 * *Background on the Ticket:* Mohammed provided background information on the ticket, explaining that the issue arises when an asset is registered and the product is fully published. The swapped asset gets released without going through QC or any warning message, which is not ideal.

 * *Discussion with Rithwik:* Rohit and Rithwik discussed the decision to check both the full publish status and the release date for the warning message. They also talked about the importance of keeping the conditions consistent across different sides of the system.

 * *Concerns about Full Publish Status:* Rohit raised concerns about the importance of the full publish status for the EOM team. He questioned whether the system should check for both the release date and the full publish status, as there might be situations where a product is released but not fully published.

 * *QC Notes and Linking:* Rohit and Rithwik discussed the importance of QC notes in the linking process. They considered whether the system should check if QC notes are locked before allowing the linking of a new asset to a fully published product.

 * *Immersive Assets and QC Notes:* Rohit and Rithwik discussed the specific requirements for immersive assets, including the need for QC notes to be locked before linking. They considered whether the system should have additional validations for immersive assets compared to other asset types.

 * *Discussion with Mike:* Rohit and Mike discussed the importance of QC notes and the potential issues that could arise if QC notes are not locked before linking an asset to a fully published product. They considered whether to implement a hard block or a warning message for this situation.

 * *Decision on QC Notes:* Mike suggested that it is low risk to leave the system as is, without implementing a hard block for QC notes. He emphasized that the current system should be sufficient and that any issues could be addressed through tickets if they arise.

 * *Immersive Assets and Release Dates:* Rohit and Mike discussed the need to handle warnings differently for immersive assets, considering their specific release dates. They agreed to discuss this internally and potentially break it down into different projects.

 * *Next Steps:* Mohammed and Rohit agreed to discuss the considerations for QC lock and immersive release dates internally. They planned to break down the project into different phases and address any issues that arise in the second phase.",,hale002,jpitzer,mham001,niko001,,,"Working on issue UST-2515;05/Aug/25 5:24 PM;niko001;21600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21600,,,,21600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMSE-1516,,,,,,,,,,"18/Jun/25 5:24 PM;hale002;6.17.2025 call - UST - Mini Refinement - Warning message on asset swap & New registration for full published, post-release products-20250617_140330-Meeting Recording.mp4;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2570392/6.17.2025+call+-+UST+-+Mini+Refinement+-+Warning+message+on+asset+swap+%26+New+registration+for+full+published%2C+post-release+products-20250617_140330-Meeting+Recording.mp4","24/Jun/25 3:53 PM;hale002;Full Publish Warning Message.xlsx;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2577154/Full+Publish+Warning+Message.xlsx","25/Aug/25 7:41 PM;jpitzer;image-2025-08-25-13-41-58-099.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2654855/image-2025-08-25-13-41-58-099.png","25/Aug/25 7:51 PM;jpitzer;image-2025-08-25-13-51-34-333.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2654872/image-2025-08-25-13-51-34-333.png","25/Aug/25 8:02 PM;jpitzer;image-2025-08-25-14-02-19-026.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2654892/image-2025-08-25-14-02-19-026.png","28/Jul/25 4:59 PM;mham001;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2619528/screenshot-1.png","28/Jul/25 5:03 PM;mham001;screenshot-2.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2619539/screenshot-2.png","28/Jul/25 5:04 PM;mham001;screenshot-3.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2619550/screenshot-3.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3doin:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S14,DSC_2025_S15,DSC_2025_S16,DSC_2025_S17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,feature-2615-V2,hotfix-Aug-SME-US_1,hotfix,feature-UST-2515-Linking_Warning_Message,release,UST-2627-filetype-restriction-mbc-release,develop,hotfix-feature-AOMA3-2873-UI-A3-Export-Vinyl-Workspace-name-and-CT-usage,master,true,"28/Jul/25 5:06 PM;mham001;DEV Test results

There is an issue if a user clears the last asset tied master and then proceeds to register a new asset before the other asset finishes unregistering. The new upload will still use the old job that we are updating to purge and clearing out the file packages for which leads to a data issue. We should better handle this scenario

*Dev Notes:*

"Implement ""Asset Upload Job Status"" Page",UST-2473,1892275,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,22/Apr/25 8:58 PM,18/Aug/25 5:31 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,18/Jul/25 10:08 PM,,AOMA-2.112.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+

We need to implement a new page called {*}“Asset Upload Job Status”{*}, similar in layout to the existing {*}Registration Job Status page{*}. While the Registration Job Status page currently shows upload status at the product level only, there are cases where a product contains multiple tracks, and each track may have a different upload outcome (some succeed, others fail). This new interface will allow users to monitor the upload status at the track level.

The following features should be implemented:

1. A new column called “Asset Upload ID” should be added 

2. Two ways to access the new page:
       I.  Via the *Asset Administration menu* (if the user has the appropriate permission).
       II.  By clicking on the *Job ID hyperlink* in the Registration Job Status page. The current Job ID field should be converted from plain text into a clickable link. When accessed this way, the *Job ID filter* in the new page should be pre-filled accordingly.

3. In the new page, the *Date filter* should default to showing data from the *past two days* only. Users must manually adjust the filter to see older records.

4. *Master #* column should be clickable, but the info icon should be removed in the first phase

5. Remove the *Security Group* column from this view.

6. Access control:
        I. Users with *REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL* permission can view all upload jobs, and filter by username.
        II. Users with *REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW* permission can only view their own jobs, and the username filter should be pre-filled with their username and greyed out.

7. Only users with *REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL* or *REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW* permissions can see the Asset Upload Job Status option in the {*}Asset Administration menu{*}.

8. *Sorting* on the page should ensure the *most recent Asset Upload ID appears first* (at the top)

+*MockUps:*+

!Asset Upload Job Status -- menu option.png|width=468,height=682!

+*User Story:*+

*As a* system user,
*I want* to view detailed track-level upload statuses in the Asset Upload Job Status page,
*So that* I can verify the status of each uploaded track, especially when products contain multiple assets with different outcomes.

{color:#ff0000}Currently, the {*}Type{*}, {*}Status{*}, and *Asset Upload #* filters are not functional. All other filters are working as expected. These three filters will be made active in the August build.{color}

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+
1. *Given* the user has REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL or REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW permission,
*When* they open the main menu,
*Then* they should see the “Asset Upload Job Status” option.

2. *Given* the user does *NOT* have REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL or REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW permission,
*When* they open the main menu,
*Then* they should *NOT* see the “Asset Upload Job Status” option.

3. *Given* the user is on the Registration Job Status page,
*When* they click on a Job ID,
*Then* they should be redirected to the Asset Upload Job Status page with the {*}Job ID filter pre-filled{*}.

4. *Given* the user opens the Asset Upload Job Status page directly from menu option,
*When* the page loads,
*Then* the Date filter should default to the last two days’ records.

5. *Given* the user has REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL permission,
*When* they use the username filter,
*Then* they can enter any username as a filter to view corresponding upload statuses.

*6. Given* a user has the REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW_ALL permission,
*When* they click the Job ID hyperlink on the Registration Job Status page,
*Then* they should be redirected to the Asset Upload Job Status page,
       *And* the page should display all upload jobs associated with that Job ID.

7. *Given* the user has only REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW permission,
*When* they access the Asset Upload Job Status page,
*Then* the page should be pre-filtered with their own username and only shows relevant jobs.

*8. Given* a user has the REGISTRATION_STATUS_VIEW permission,
*When* they click the Job ID hyperlink on the Registration Job Status page,
*Then* they should be redirected to the Asset Upload Job Status page,
        *And* the page should only display upload jobs associated with that user for that Job ID.

*9. Given* an asset contains a Master #,
*When* the Asset Upload Job Status page is displayed,
*Then* the Master # column should be clickable and direct users to master details page, but no info icon should be displayed for now.

*10. Given* upload records are loaded on the page,
*When* they are sorted,
*Then* the most recent Asset Upload ID should appear at the top of the list.

11. *Given* the user is viewing the Asset Upload Job Status page,
*When* columns are displayed,
*Then* each column should display as order below:

Asset Upload #

Type

Master # (Asset level)

Original File Name

When users register cover assets in UST, the system performs Preflight Validation checks after an asset is uploaded. Each validation scenario should display a message consistent with the defined Registration Validation Worksheet, which lists all possible validation cases and their corresponding messages.

+*User Story:*+
*As a* user of UST,
*I want* the validation messages displayed during asset registration to exactly match the predefined messages in the Registration Validation Worksheet,
*so that* I receive consistent and clear feedback for any validation errors.

 

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+
 # Aspect Ratio Validation – Graphics, cover
    Given the asset’s media type is Graphics, asset type is cover, and configuration is Digital,
    When the Preflight Validation checks the Aspect Ratio,
    Then:
        If the Aspect Ratio is 1:1(square) , it should {color:#4c9aff}pass{color}, display {color:#ff0000}no validation message.{color}
        If the Aspect Ratio is not 1:1 (square), it should{color:#4c9aff} fail{color}, display : {color:#ff0000}The aspect ratio of this asset does not meet compliance. The image must be square. <br>+<Actual dimensions of submitted asset here> Please correct and resubmit.   Compliance guidelines can be found here: [https://mediaguide.sonymusic.com/graphics/cover-art/]{color}
        If the Aspect Ratio dimensions values are null (unable to calculate) , it should {color:#4c9aff}pass with warning{color}, display:
{color:#ff0000}The Value for this attribute is not readable from the header data of the submitted file. It is recommened to resave the asset(s) in a recent version of Adobe Photoshop to apply the appropriate header data and try again. Alternatively you can proceed as-is with the possibility that the file could fail secondary validations {color}

{color:#ff0000}           Given the asset’s media type is Graphics, asset type is cover, and configuration is physical,{color}
           When the Preflight Validation checks the Aspect Ratio,
{color:#172b4d}      {color}     {color:#172b4d}Then:{color}
{color:#172b4d}                   If the Aspect Ratio dimensions values are readable, it should {color}{color:#4c9aff}pass{color}{color:#172b4d}, display{color} {color:#de350b}no validation message.{color}
                  {color:#172b4d} If the Aspect Ratio dimensions values are null (unable to calculate) , it should {color}{color:#4c9aff}pass with warning{color}{color:#172b4d}, display:{color}
      {color:#de350b}  The Value for this attribute is not readable from the header data of the submitted file. It is recommened to resave the asset(s) in a recent version of Adobe Photoshop to apply the appropriate header data and try again. Alternatively you can proceed as-is with the possibility that the file could fail secondary validations {color}

2. Bits per channel/Bit depth Validation – Graphics, cover
    Given the asset’s media type is Graphics, asset type is cover, 
    When the Preflight Validation checks Bits per channel/Bit depth,
    Then:
        If Bits per channel/Bit depth is 8 bit or 16 bit, it should {color:#4c9aff}pass{color}, display {color:#de350b}no validation message.{color}
        If Bits per channel/Bit depth is NOT 8 bit or 16 bit, it should{color:#0747a6} {color:#4c9aff}fail{color}{color}, display : {color:#de350b}The bit depth of this asset does not meet compliance. The image must be 8 bit or 16 bit. Please correct and resubmit.   {color}
{color:#de350b}Compliance guidelines can be found here: https://mediaguide.sonymusic.com/graphics/cover-art/{color}
        If Bits per channel/Bit depth is null, it should{color:#4c9aff} pass with warning{color}, display: {color:#de350b}The Value for this attribute is not readable from the header data of the submitted file.  It is recommened to resave the asset(s) in a recent version of Adobe Photoshop to apply the appropriate header data and try again. {color}
{color:#de350b}Alternatively you can proceed as-is with the possibility that the file could fail secondary validations {color}

To support export of mobile products via MBC, several UI changes are required in the interface. A new radio button ""Mobile Lookup"" will be introduced as a search option. When this option is selected:
• The search box text will change to ""Enter Product Number"", as only mobile product numbers will be supported (ISRCs or other product Lookup will not return any results).
• On the right side of the UI, under *Audio Options,* only one option, *""Mobile Clip""* will be displayed. 
• If the mobile product includes *cover* content, the *Cover Option* will also be displayed.
    Upon selecting Select Destination, under Audio Format, the available CTs will be:

If the parent rep owner & maintenance owner are both SME US and if the imprint label is null (If no imprint label is available) then by default we need to populate ""The Orchard"" security group.

 # Product A has SME US parent rep owner & maintenance owner and imprint label name in our list (Ex: *Zelig Records)* 
 ## Clicking import SG's on pre-release product should add the mapped sg to the list (Ex: {*}Zelig{*})
 ## After add one more SG the user execute access on has access to they should be able to register with imported SG 
 # Product B has SME US parent rep owner & maintenance owner and imprint label not in the above list
 ## Clicking import SG's on pre-release product should add *Orchard* sg to the list
 ## After add one more SG the user actually has access to they should be able to register with imported SG

*Desc:*
Currently there are no mapping for SME US parent rep owner & maintenance owner we need to be adding a mapping for SME US.

If the parent rep owner & maintenance owner are both SME US then the system should look up for the imprint label. If the imprint label is of any of the below then the respective security group should be populated.

If the parent rep owner & maintenance owner are both SME US and if the imprint label is null (If no imprint label is available) then by default we need to populate ""The Orchard"" security group.

*SME US Imprint Label List:*
 * (dis)harmony
 * Monument Records
 * Palm Tree Records
 * Three Six Zero Recordings

As a user, I want to see the “Last Updated By” field showing the username of the person who registered an asset when I view a product, so that I can identify who is responsible for the latest changes.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I have opened a product,
*WHEN* I view the product details,
*THEN* I should see the “Last Updated By” field populated with the username of the user who registered the asset.

*THEN* I should see the “Last Updated” field populated with the date and time of when the last update occurred.

 

*User Story 3:* Remove Registration and Modification Fields
As a user, I want the “Registered By,” “Registration Date,” “Modified By,” and “Modified Date” fields to be removed from the UST header section, so that I am not confused by outdated or irrelevant information.

Add Extra Validation for A3 calls/New A3 endpoint for VSC,UST-2521,1904890,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,spag001,spag001,spag001,12/May/25 8:14 PM,01/Aug/25 6:31 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,15/Jul/25 9:37 PM,,AOMA-2.112.0,,,0,,"*Desc:*

If a uploads a brand new VSC via A3, and then attempts to do so again after registration without loading, the request is missing expected information (trackMasterId) which causes issues in the registration (it will attempt to create a new trackMaster).

We could add validations to prevent this but I think a better long term is to create a specific registration endpoint for A3 to use for their VSC workflows. In that approach we can ask them for less information and do the looks on our end.

For scope of this ticket we are just handling extract. File upload will be handled at a later time.

Improve Product Lookup performance for bulk product numbers in MBC,UST-2523,1906698,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,14/May/25 8:46 PM,28/Jul/25 7:19 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,15/Jul/25 8:02 PM,,AOMA-2.112.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+

Currently, when users enter a large number of product numbers—sometimes in the hundreds or thousands—into the search box of the Media Batch Converter feature and click the Lookup button, the system takes an extended time to load the results. We would like to optimize and improve the lookup performance for such cases.

(We plan to skip all validations when we look up products, just a simple lookup query based on product number. we only implement validation when submitting for export.)

+*User Story:*+
*As a* user of the Media Batch Converter,
*I want* the system to quickly process and return results even when I input a large number of product IDs,
{*}So tha{*}t I can complete high-volume export tasks more efficiently without long wait times.

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+
*1. Given* the user enters a large number of product IDs (e.g. 500+),
*When* they click the Lookup button,
*Then* the system should return results within an optimized and reasonable timeframe.
*2. Given* a performance enhancement is implemented,
*When* compared to the current average lookup time for high-volume input,
*Then* the improved lookup process should show measurable time reduction.",,mbrice1,wang042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DPSA-30992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DPSA-30969,UST-2550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Jul/25 5:31 PM;wang042;image (96).png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2599895/image+%2896%29.png","11/Jul/25 5:23 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-11-11-23-13-457.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2599882/image-2025-07-11-11-23-13-457.png","11/Jul/25 8:33 PM;wang042;image-2025-07-11-14-33-57-141.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2600258/image-2025-07-11-14-33-57-141.png","11/Jul/25 9:03 PM;wang042;image-2025-07-11-15-03-14-019.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2600304/image-2025-07-11-15-03-14-019.png","15/Jul/25 5:46 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-15-11-46-15-064.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2603374/image-2025-07-15-11-46-15-064.png","15/Jul/25 7:27 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-15-13-27-37-632.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2603601/image-2025-07-15-13-27-37-632.png","15/Jul/25 7:27 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-15-13-27-44-268.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2603602/image-2025-07-15-13-27-44-268.png","15/Jul/25 7:31 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-15-13-31-56-927.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2603612/image-2025-07-15-13-31-56-927.png","15/Jul/25 8:00 PM;mbrice1;image-2025-07-15-14-00-21-616.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2603649/image-2025-07-15-14-00-21-616.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2577,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3et9r:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S10,DSC_2025_S11,DSC_2025_S12,DSC_2025_S13,DSC_2025_S14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,feature-UST-2523,feature-UST-2523-v1,feature-UST-2559,develop,,,,,,true,"11/Jul/25 5:23 PM;mbrice1;DEV testing with

*1. Behavior Based on Product Lookup Type (Product / Product+ISRC)*

*Description:*
Update lookup behavior to distinguish between pure product number input and product + ISRC input. A pure product number lookup returns only the product entry level details. The associated tracks will only be fetched when the user expands the product. If both product number and ISRC are entered, only the product level details will be returned, and only matching ISRC track should be fetched and shown after user click expand button.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
    *Given* the user enters a product number only
*When* the Product lookup is performed
*Then* only the product is displayed, and track-level data is fetched only upon expansion
    *Given* the user enters a combination of product number and ISRC
*When* the Product lookup is performed
*Then* only the product is displayed, and the specified ISRC track are fetched and displayed upon expansion

*2. Conditional Display of Audio/Video/Graphics Export Options*

*Description:*
The checkboxes for audio, video, and graphic export options should dynamically display based on the master types present in the searched products.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
    *Given* the user looks up products that include audio master types
*When* the export options panel loads
*Then* the Audio export option checkbox should be displayed
    *Given* the user looks up products that include video master types
*When* the export options panel loads
*Then* the Video export option checkbox should be displayed

(Cover Option)
*Given* the user searches for products in MBC,
        *And* at least one of the searched products contains registered cover masters,
*Then* the Cover checkbox shall be displayed under the Graphics Options section,
*And* the user shall be able to select or unselect the Cover checkbox.

(VSC Option)
*Given* the user searches for products in MBC,
        *And* at least one of the searched products contain a video asset,
*Then* the VSC checkbox shall be displayed under the Graphics Options section,
*And* the user shall be able to select or unselect the VSC checkbox.

*Given* the user searches for products in MBC,
        *And* none of the searched products contain registered cover master,
        *And* none of the searched products contain video assets,
*Then* the Graphics Options section shall not be displayed.

 

*3. De-duplication of Lookup Results and Info Icon Explanation*

*Description:*
If users input duplicate product numbers or product+ISRC combinations, only unique entries should be shown in the results. Any duplicates should be captured in the Info Icon section with a new column labeled “Product/ISRC Number” and a note explaining that duplicates are hidden.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
(Duplicated Entry Found)
*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the searched product number, or the combination of product number and ISRC, is duplicated in the user’s search input,
*Then* the duplicated entry shall not be displayed in the search results,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display a description indicating that the entry was excluded because it is duplicated.

(Non-Existent Product Lookup with Duplicate Searches)
*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the searched product number, or the combination of product number and ISRC, does not exist in the system,
    *And* the user searches for this same non-existent product more than once,
*Then* no search result details shall be displayed for the non-existent product,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display a description stating that the product cannot be found in the system for the first occurrence,
    *And* for subsequent duplicate entries of the same non-existent product, the Info Icon shall display a description indicating that these entries were excluded because they are duplicated.

!image-2025-07-09-16-16-35-269.png!

*4. Product Lookup: Product /Product+ISRC not found*

*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the user searches for a product number that does not exist in the system,
*Then* no entry details shall be displayed for that product number,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display a message indicate Product not found.

*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the user searches for a *combination of product number and ISRC,*
    *And* the product number exists in the system but the ISRC does not exist for that product,
*Then* Product level details shall NOT be displayed for that product + ISRC combination,

    *And* no details shall be displayed for the ISRCs that do not exist,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display a message stating “ISRC not found.”

*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the user searches for {*}a single product number with multiple ISRCs{*},
    *And* some or all of the searched ISRCs do not exist for that product,
*Then* the details shall be displayed for the product that exist,
    *And* no details shall be displayed for the ISRCs that do not exist,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display the following information in a single row:
• the product number in the first column,
• and, in the second column, a list of all ISRCs under that product number that were not found.

*5. Product vs. ISRC Lookup Count Display*

*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
    *And* the user enters 10 product numbers / combinations of product number and ISRC,
    *And* only 3 unique, valid product numbers exist in the system among the searched entries,
*Then* for Product Lookup, the Info Icon section shall display the message:
“Showing X out of 10 products.”
where X represents the number of valid entries found.

*Given* the user performed the above product lookup,
    *And* the user transfers to the ISRC Lookup,
*Then* the message next to the Info Icon shall display:
“showing 3 products.”
    *And* the count 10 shall no longer be displayed, because the context has shifted to unique, valid products only.

*6. Select All Button State*

*Description:*
The “Select All” button should reflect the selection status of products/tracks: fully checked, partially checked, or unchecked.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
(Select All at Global Level)
*Given* the user views the hierarchical selection tree with the top-level Select All checkbox,
*When* the user selects the top-level Select All checkbox,
*Then* all products, all sides under each product, and all tracks under each side shall be selected.

(Deselecting a Lower-Level Item Updates Parent States)
*Given* the top-level Select All checkbox is selected,
    *And* all child items are initially selected,
*When* the user deselects a single track,
*Then* the following checkboxes shall change to a partially selected state:
• the Select All checkbox for the corresponding side,
• the Select All checkbox for the corresponding product,
• the top-level Select All checkbox.

(Scope of Select All)
*Given* a Select All checkbox exists at any level (global, product, or side),
*When* the user selects that checkbox,
*Then* it shall only select or deselect all immediate child items within its scope:
• The top-level Select All controls all products.
• A product-level Select All controls all sides under that product.
• A side-level Select All controls all tracks under that side.

*Given* a user has partially selected items under a side or product,
*When* not all child items are selected,
*Then* the parent checkbox shall display a partially selected state,
    *And* this partial state shall impact upward to the top-level checkbox if applicable.

*Given* the user has deselected all items under a side, product, or top-level,
*When* no child checkboxes remain selected,
*Then* the corresponding parent checkbox shall display as unchecked rather than partially selected.

 

*7.*  *Submit button remains enabled after closing the panel without applying, if data is valid and unchanged*

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria*{color}
*Given* the user has previously opened the “Select Destination” panel,
    *And* all mandatory fields have been filled in with valid information and saved,
*When* the user reopens the “Select Destination” panel,
    *And* reviews the data without making any changes,
    *And* clicks the X to close the panel without clicking Apply,
*Then* the Submit button shall remain enabled,
    *And* the user shall be able to proceed by clicking the Submit button.

*8. Product Lookup performance improvement*

*{color:#ff0000}Acceptance Criteria{color}*

*Given* the user performs a product lookup using either a set of Product Numbers, or a set of Product Number + ISRC combinations,
*And* the number of items being looked up is the same as in previous system versions,
*When* the lookup is executed,
*Then* the system shall complete the lookup noticeably faster than in previous versions

*1. Behavior Based on Product Lookup Type (Product / Product+ISRC)*

*Description:*
Update lookup behavior to distinguish between pure product number input and product + ISRC input. A pure product number lookup returns only the product entry level details. The associated tracks will only be fetched when the user expands the product. If both product number and ISRC are entered, only the product level details will be returned, and only matching ISRC track should be fetched and shown after user click expand button.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
    *Given* the user enters a product number only
*When* the Product lookup is performed
*Then* only the product is displayed, and track-level data is fetched only upon expansion !image-2025-07-16-13-06-56-588.png!

*3. De-duplication of Lookup Results and Info Icon Explanation*

*Description:*
If users input duplicate product numbers or product+ISRC combinations, only unique entries should be shown in the results. Any duplicates should be captured in the Info Icon section with a new column labeled “Product/ISRC Number” and a note explaining that duplicates are hidden.

{color:#ff0000}*Acceptance Criteria:*{color}
(Duplicated Entry Found)
*Given* the user performs a product lookup in the system,
*When* the searched product number, or the combination of product number and ISRC, is duplicated in the user’s search input,
*Then* the duplicated entry shall not be displayed in the search results,

 * Per-Product Export Triggering:

The export should be triggered immediately after a product's validation completes, instead of waiting for all products to be validated.
 * Export Blocking Conditions:

Export must only proceed for products that pass all the required validations (e.g. product availability, media presence, valid attributes).

If validation fails, no export request should be made for that product, and the failure reason must be logged.
 * Concurrency Handling:

Export operations must be safely executed in a parallel or async-safe manner, ensuring no race conditions or shared state corruption occurs.
 * Export Results Tracking:

The result of each product's export (including export ID or failure reason) should be captured and recorded in the overall batch export response.
 * Batch Status Management:

The batch status should be updated to IN_PROGRESS only if at least one product has been successfully exported.

If all products fail validation, the batch should be marked as FAILED.
 * Logging and Error Handling:

Each product's export process must log success or failure independently.
Any unexpected errors should not block the export of other products.",,kuma011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA2/UST,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UST-2577,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,"2|i3iej3:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,DSC_2025_S13,DSC_2025_S14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a discussion with the A3 team and kafka team we have decided to change our approach for this project. Rather than use a new job_status they would prefer us to use a flag to denote partial registrations. This will help prevent code changes from kafka and A3 linking side.

With that in mind can we add a new column in the asset_registration_jobs called 'partially_registered_fl'. We will be treating null as false so no need for a backfill.

Also we no longer need the new job_status we added 'Partially Registered' so this can be removed. This only ever used in dev since we didn't release this feature yet so there shouldn't be any stage/prod records of using it.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks

Currently Last Updated By shows user id should we update it to email ? - Add info icon clicking should be displaying the email address

When all this field should be updated ? Registration, Asset Swap(mentioned in the AMSE that this should be included), Delete ?

For the last updated field should we have the same date format ?

*As per our discussion on the call Registered By & Modified By are displaying the same value so Should we have everywhere as Registered By & Registration Date ?*

Restrict Aspect Ratio Modification Options for Video Uploads in MBC,UST-2557,1919772,,User Story,Done,UST,Unified Submission Tool,software,hale002,,,Normal,Done,wang042,wang042,wang042,05/Jun/25 10:50 PM,23/Jul/25 4:39 PM,12/Oct/25 4:16 PM,15/Jul/25 11:36 PM,,AOMA-2.112.0,,,0,,"'+*Description:*+

When a user uploads a video file via the Select Files option in the Media Batch Converter, and the video has dimensions of 1920x1080, the Aspect Ratio Modification dropdown currently shows four options. However, only Square Pixel is supported by the system for this specific dimension.

If the user mistakenly selects one of the other three unsupported options, the export will fail. This creates unnecessary failed jobs for users.

To prevent this:
• When the system detects a video file with 1920x1080 dimensions,
• The Aspect Ratio Modification field should display only one option: Square Pixel (the only supported setting),
• All unsupported options should be hidden from the dropdown in this case.

*And we need to consider all use cases with different dimensions.*

Currently, when users enter a large number of ISRC numbers—sometimes in the hundreds or thousands—into the search box of the Media Batch Converter feature and click the Lookup button, the system takes an extended time to load the results. We would like to optimize and improve the ISRC lookup performance.

+*User Story:*+
*As a* user of the Media Batch Converter,
*I want* the system to quickly process and return results even when I input a large number of ISRCs,
{*}So tha{*}t I can complete high-volume export tasks more efficiently without long wait times.

{color:#ff0000}+*Acceptance Criteria:*+{color}
*1. Given* the user enters a large number of ISRCs (e.g. 500+),
*When* they click the Lookup button,
*Then* the system should return results within an optimized and reasonable timeframe.

*2. Given* a performance enhancement is implemented,
*When* compared to the current average lookup time for high-volume input,
*Then* the improved lookup process should show measurable time reduction.

*3. Given* the user performs a ISRC lookup 
*When* the Info Icon panel is opened
*Then* the first column title should be “ISRC Number”

!image-2025-07-09-17-00-45-477.png!

*4. Given* the user performs an ISRC lookup in the system,
*When* the entered ISRC does not exist in the system and is invalid,
*Then* no matching product/ISRC details shall be displayed for that ISRC,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display the message: “There is no matching product found for the ISRC.”

*5. Given* the user performs an ISRC lookup in the system,
*When* the same ISRC is entered multiple times in the lookup input,
*Then* the duplicate ISRC entries shall be displayed only once,
    *And* the Info Icon shall display the message indicate Duplicate ISRC ID.

The current EOM Message Sender interface is still based on an outdated design and needs to be redesigned.

We plan to redesign the entire UI in Angular to align with other features in AOMA and provide a cleaner layout. Alongside the UI changes, we also need to review and update several backend endpoints.
This update will involve defining a new user interaction flow and implementing necessary changes to both the frontend and backend components of the feature.

With the refactor of DVD DDP we introduced two new assetSubTypes for each dvd ddp layer. Due to this new addition though I believe the UpdateLegacySearch service needs to be updated to support these two, as currently the dvdddpcount in the search_for_products table is not updating.

2) When unregistered (this is when something was registered to the master but unregistered successfully) 
3) When Deleted ( this when sometimes registration fails and show failed status and the users delete the entry so status changes to deleted)

We’ve noticed that duplicate folders are sometimes created in Sony CI during export processing.

{*}Reason{*}:
Even after creating the parent folder, it doesn’t show up immediately in Sony CI’s search results. Because of this delay, the system or delivery team thinks the folder doesn’t exist and creates another one — causing duplicates.

{*}Proposed Fix{*}:
Before starting an export, we now check if the parent folder exists in Sony CI using their search API, based on the workspace ID and folder name.

If the folder isn’t found right away:
 *  We will wait and retry the search a few times.
 * Only start the export after confirming the folder exists.

NOTES:
-------
AQC Project Notes:
------------------
*Every stereo audio needs to go through AQC by default
*Every user needs to have the AQC role so everything getting registered goes through AQC
*Manual Full QC should be based on user permission only if the user has permission the user can request for the manual QC processes 
*If manual qc or AQC is in progress it should not go to the published status
*user preferences for QC should be part of the user management module and the onboarding process. They discussed the need to ask new users if their content requires full QC during onboarding.
*During the onboarding process, new users will be asked if their content requires full QC. This step ensures that QC preferences are captured early and incorporated into the workflow.
*need to capture the user ID for every efficacy check in the AQC process. They emphasized the importance of distinguishing between affiliate and GMP efficacy checks.
*Affiliate vs. GMP Checks: There was a discussion on distinguishing between affiliate and GMP efficacy checks. This distinction is important to ensure that checks are weighted appropriately based on the source.
*By capturing user IDs, the team can generate detailed reports and analyze the efficacy checks based on departments. This analysis helps in identifying trends and areas for improvement.
*discussed allowing users to opt for an AQC review before publishing their masters. This option provides flexibility and ensures that users can verify the quality of their content.
*A user-specific permission was considered to manage the flexibility in opting for AQC reviews. This system ensures that only authorized users can make such requests.
*discussed the process of creating JIRA tickets for QC requests and the possibility of using subtasks for multiple submissions. They considered the need to update open tickets with new submissions to avoid creating multiple tickets for the same product.

WORKFLOW:
----------
USE CASE 1
User has Manual Full QC Permission:
Step 1(User has not checked the checkbox): 
Goes through the same regular AQC workflow as in Use case 2

Step 2(User has checked the checkbox) : 
User clicks on  select file and once they select the file on the preflight screen we need to have a checkbox 
to for Manual Full QC. 
If this checkbox is checked then the QC Notes 4 fields should become available for the user to fill in 
If the 
 
Step 2:
User clicks on the check box
The preflight window should have the text fields: Jira Number, QC Urgency, Request Complete Date & Comments
WPTS ticket gets created
 
Note for step 2: In this case if check box checked we need to update the QC notes header saying Manual QC pending
 
 
USE CASE 2
User does not have Manual Full QC permission (AQC)
No WPTS ticket created  
Goes only through AQC 
Once AQC is completed user should receive an email notification: 
1. Full Master Side - If all tracks are successful for AQC - Are we sending an email or are we sending emails only for failed ones, If its going to be sending emails are we adding it to the duration mismatch email or is it going to be a new email - CAN HAVE A SEPERATE EMAIL
2. Full Master Side - If few tracks fail are we adding it to the duration mismatch email or is it going to be a new email ?
3. Individual tracks  - Same as above  

======================================================================================================================================================== 
Follow-up tasks:
-----------------
User Management Module: Adjust the onboarding process to include questions about whether the content uploader requires full QC from GMP. (Muhammad)
QC Workflow: Confirm if the system is already checking at the header level for QC notes and ensure it prevents publishing without locking. (the team)
QC Notes Interface: Provide a button in the QC notes interface to send content to GMP for full QC if the user decides after AQC review. (the team)
Subtask Functionality: Explore the subtask functionality in JIRA to handle multiple track submissions under one main ticket. (the team)
JIRA Workflow: Refine the JIRA workflow based on different use cases encountered by GMP when it comes to QC. (the team)
Track Master Level QC: Discuss internally and propose a solution for handling asset swaps and ensuring QC notes are updated and locked at the track master level. (the team)
Temporary Audio Marking: Implement a badge and checkbox system to indicate temporary audio tracks in the UST interface. (the team)
Temporary Audio Validation: Determine if temporary audio tracks should skip validation and confirm with the GRPC group. (the team)

Questions:
-----------
Should we always generate AQC or would we not in some workflows? (Matt.S) Answer - YES (Need to double check with Rohit)

AQC and Manual QC are visualized together but separate in terms of supply chain policy. 

AQC - should have no effect on publish ability the notes merely exist, users can choose to review them. Users can also choose to edit AQC notes and update the efficacy of the notes, noting whether they are valid or invalid. 

Manual QC - has an immediate effect on Publish-Ability. If manual QC notes are created, the product cannot be published until the manual Qc notes are locked.  

AQC is an automated process which will/should occur on any registration of a supported master asset. Any time a supported master is registered AQC should be run, whether it be initial registration, or an asset swap. We must discuss the swap logic. 

Manual QC is a manual process wherein an engineer Performs a critical listen QC and validation of the automatically generated AQC notes. Manual QC notes exist therefore manual Qc notes lock must be completed to allow publish. Currently, a QC note has to exist at the track level in order to require Qc notes lock. This must be expended to if QC notes exist, even just header data and a QC comment. Notes ex

NOTES FROM ABOVE AS DISCUSSED WITH RITHWIK(***Mo's analysis)
If the AQC flags something then the QC should go through manual qc irrespective of whether the user has the manual qc permission - ***Question Should all users by default have QC NOTES VIEW permission ?  

If the AQC does not flag something then the QC should get auto locked and this can get auto published(Current workflow if no manual QC).

Phase 1: AQC Notifications:

New Subscription: AQC Completion 

this subscription is used to send AQC notification for all new stereo registration that are going through AQC... (with AQC attachment)

+*NOTE: Mike wanted to have both manual & AQC as a combined attachment*+ *- This should only happen when the AQC is locked & the user requests for manual QC (Confirmed by Mike on 7/10/2025)*

Meeting notes: * *AQC Notifications:* Rohit and Mohammed discussed the need for AQC notifications to be added to JIRA phase one. They emphasized the importance of sending notifications when AQC is completed, especially for multiple tracks registered together.
 * 
 ** *Notification Process:* Rohit explained that Vicki proposed sending email notifications with attachments for AQC notes, which can then be forwarded to ANR for review. This process ensures that GMP or release plans can opt for detailed QC workflows if necessary.
 ** *JIRA Documentation:* Rohit emphasized the need to document the AQC notification process in JIRA, specifically in phase one. He instructed Mohammed to add the AQC notifications to JIRA to ensure proper tracking and implementation.
 ** *Multiple Tracks:* Rohit discussed scenarios where multiple tracks are registered together, highlighting the need to wait for all AQC processes to complete before sending a single notification for those tracks. This ensures that all relevant AQC information is included in the notification.
 * *Separate AQC Email:* Mohammed and Matthew agreed that AQC notifications should be sent as a separate email rather than included in the registration email. This ensures clarity and avoids mismatches in timing.
 ** *Separate Email:* Mohammed and Matthew discussed the importance of sending AQC notifications as separate emails to avoid timing mismatches. They agreed that including AQC information in the registration email could lead to confusion, so a separate email is more effective.

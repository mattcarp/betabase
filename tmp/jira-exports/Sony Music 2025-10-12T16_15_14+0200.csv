*Pre-conditions:*

User is exporting audio or video assets via A3

*Acceptance Criteria:*

WHEN user ONLY selects CT 4202 in dropdown menu
AND user selects either clip option ""Program Only"" and ""Preview"" (video)
OR user selects either clip option ""Default Clip"" and ""Custom Clip"" (audio)
-AND user clicks Export-

Source copy conversions output the whole master as is. Please select a different CT for a proper converted output, OR the 'Full' version for a source copy of the asset.{_}""

 

WHEN user selects clip options ""Program Only"" or ""Preview"" (video)
OR user selects either clip option ""Default Clip"" or ""Custom Clip"" (audio)

WHEN user selects clip options ""Program Only"" or ""Preview"" (video)
OR user selects either clip option ""Default Clip"" or ""Custom Clip"" (audio)
AND user selects multiple CTs for Export (CT 4202 included)
THEN display ""hard block"" error message above Export button in red text, and prevent Export: ""{_}ERROR{_}{_}:{_} {_}Multiple conversion types have been selected, one of which is source copy. C{_}{_}lipped asset + source copy CT combinations are not allowed{_}{_}. Please confirm you need a source copy of the selected master and submit in a separate Export job{_}""
 * _Ex:_ User selects CT 1 and 4202, and all 3 clip types (Full, Default and Custom)
 * 10/3/25: Confirmed with GMP on UST call to switch from warning to error...this is to simplify the logic.

 

WHEN user selects a DDP asset for Export
AND user selects source copy CT 4202 (alone or with other CT's)
THEN display ""hard block"" error message above Export button in red text, and prevent Export: ""{_}ERROR:{_} {_}A combination of DDP + source copy conversion has been selected.

 * When we implement DDP support for physical destinations/flow, this AC will not be included/relevant for it, since we are using CT 4202 there. This AC is purely for digital flow purposes.

UI will differ between Sony Ci and Direct Mail Delivery somewhat, so there will be 2 tickets. Decommissioning for some plants won't happen until we add support for other physical masters.

-_Important: do we add virtual support?_ Split _ticket between adding Virtual side master support, and then this one having to do with just the destination and audio DDP._-
 * _When creating, for virtual, we will just show ""Audio Master DDP [master ID]"" as it currently does in A2/legacy interface_

-Full master DVD DDP/Blu-ray (if this can be combined with DDP above, lets try that)-

*Pre-conditions:*

User is on product details page, whose config can link to:
 * Audio DDP
 * DVD DDP
 * Blu-ray
 * Virtual Side audio DDP/DVD DDP/Blu-ray

User has permission AOMA3 EXPORT and proper view/execute access

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

+_UI tasks_+

New destination ""{color:#4c9aff}*Manufacturing Plant - USA - Sonopress Audio - DVD - Bluray (Sony Ci)*{color}"" should be displayed in A3 Export; this will be gated by permission AOMA3 EXPORT PHYSICAL SUPPLY CHAIN ({_}same permission as for PKGF export{_})
 * We should not use CES permission since this is not a CES plant

 

Continue to gate A3 Export button behind AOMA3 EXPORT permission and proper view/execute sec group access

Do NOT add audio CTs as part of interface (we will only use CT 4202)

Display both Standard and Consolidated as radio buttons, and default the selection to Standard.
 * _*01/02/2025:*_ Went with keeping design generic, after discussion. Default can change for plant in the future, so it has to be set up somewhere (ISC Japan for example does not accept Standard). UI team can decide which looks best (dropdown, radio buttons, etc).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN QC Notes exist for audio DDP
AND QC Notes are not approved
THEN gray out QC Notes option
AND gray out DDP option
AND display message ""QC Notes have not been approved for master(s): [masterID]""
AND block Export (make Submit button unclickable)

The SME will integrate Hive's AI Detection Technology into the SME Supply Chain in accordance with the SME Content Protection policy that forbids the dissemination of sound recordings made entirely or in part using generative AI (""GAI"") models that were not ethically trained.  

This ticket is for to make GAI scans included in UST Stereo Audio registration.

*Applicable Masters:*
Stereo Wav (16 and 24 Bit) 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*Registration* 

UST BE changes are required to perform GAI scan on every Stereo Audio Wav (16 and 24 Bit) registration and send the Kafka message 

System wide capability to turn on/off the GAI scan from BE to avoid multiple GAI scan failures in case of Hive API is down.

 

*Testing:*
Should test usual registration of Stereo Audio Wav (16 and 24 Bit) through UST to check if the registration is performed as expected after the above changes including checking of AQC status as well for those tracks which generate AQC. 

Take assets which will result in AI detection ""True"" and other few which results ""False"" to see if the AI detection is happening post registration of 16 and 24 Bit masters.

Icons should be displayed at track level in a separate column called *AI Detection* on Associated master section, Master details page and QC Notes interface.

*AI Generated Music Status* text message should be displayed in the tooltip when user hover over the info icon placed next to the column name. 

Placement of the column:
The *AI Detection* col should be placed in between Duration Column and QC Notes icon column on associated master section and master details page

On QC notes interface (View and Edit interface) the  *AI Detection* column should be placed next to AQC status column (right side)

A3 Video Export (Vantage): warning/error messaging logic for certain size/format/CT selections,AOMA3-2898,1971224,,User Story,To Do,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,kyry001,venu001,venu001,04/Sep/25 7:30 AM,09/Oct/25 3:20 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,AOMA-2.115.0,,,0,"*User story:* We recently came across an issue where a user decided to use Vantage/same conversions on a Video which was already in said format. We should add a warning modal to discourage such scenarios, and to advise to use the source copy conversion instead. We should also check the size of the asset (<50 G to temper expectations) and the format of said asset (which would trigger the source copy CT suggestion).

Checking the size will advise the user to be patient. This is also linked to another issue with Export, which is the duplication of jobs (also reported in that same DPSA); Vitaliy has already created and linked a ticket to the DPSA, and I've linked it to this ticket.

MC may also include a file size check on their system; Promo is also looking into zipping improvements (DMD and Xpress File send e-cards, which are commonly used destinations in A3)

*_10/9/25:_* This will be a UI only ticket for Phase 1
 
*Pre-conditions:*

User is trying to Export an SFV
 
*Acceptance Criteria:*

Refer to this Excel for scenarios/ testing (for Jack and other QAs): [https://sonymusicentertainment-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/manu_venugopal_dtg_sonymusic_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7291F4EF-3D3A-4618-A594-5DEE4C77E0DA%7D&file=Export_Vantage_Validations.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true]
 * {color:#de350b}Devs can also use this, and may be better than ACs below...but take note of additional tasks below AFTER the WHEN-THEN AC's{color}

 

WHEN format of source SFV is SD ProRes, HD or 2k/4k (vertical in scope also)
AND user selects clip type Full Video
AND user selects CT 12192
THEN fail the Export request and throw error message upon submission: ""ERROR: CT 12192 is not compatible with the selected Full Video clip. Please use the copy conversion CT instead (CT 4202).""

 

WHEN format of source SFV is SD ProRes, HD or 2k/4k (vertical in scope also)
AND user selects clip type Program Only
AND user selects CT 12192
AND size of SFV is < 100 G
THEN throw warning message upon submission with Y/N options: ""WARNING: You've selected CT 12192 for a Program Only clip. Please make sure you require a converted version of this asset. Contact mediaproduction@sonymusic.com for advice; consider requesting a copy (CT 4202) instead to avoid delays. Would you like to proceed?""

 

WHEN format of source SFV is SD (mpeg or ProRes) or HD
AND user selects any of the 3 clip types
THEN do not allow the user to select CT 12195
 * BE to block/hide this rather than UI; they should configure from the table, per their suggestion (per 9/18 refinement)

 

WHEN format of source SFV is 2k/4k
AND user selects any of the 3 clip types
AND user selects both CTs 12192 + 12195
AND size of SFV is <100 G
THEN throw warning message upon submission with Y/N options: ""WARNING: You’ve selected two similar conversions for this video. Please confirm that you require both outputs. If unsure, contact mediaproduction@sonymusic.com for advice, or consider requesting only one conversion to avoid delays. Would you like to continue?""
 * Test all 3 clip types here

 

WHEN file size of video is > 100 G
AND user clicks Submit or Resubmit
THEN throw warning message with red X/exit icon in top right: ""WARNING: The selected video exceeds 100GB. Processing and delivery can take extended time; please be patient! For inquiries, please contact aoma.support@sonymusic.com for advice. Do NOT submit another conversion request. Thanks!""

 

{+}_Additional UI task_{+}: For Promo Export: move CT 12195 to the 3rd section with other Vantage CTs in HQ Mezzanine, per Mike/GMP

 

Warning modal should be displayed in such a way that size check and format check can display at once (test this too)
 * As an example, if user uses CT 12192 and 12195 and the warning is thrown, AND the file size of video happens to be above >100 G, warning modal should display both accordingly

 

 

{+}_Background/Note_{+}: Per GMP, the real solution here is to make AOMA frame accurate and improve the MSAs in the system. Then, we'd need to backfill (black top and tail already exists on every SFV in the system). However, this proposal is a big project, and we need to find a workaround for now.

 

*Extra positive test cases (these should be covered in Excel above); make sure A3 Export is allowed for < 100 G SFV's when:*
 # Source SFV is of format SD mpeg, user selects any of the 3 clip types, and CT 12192
 # Source SFV is of format SD [mpeg or ProRes]/ HD/ 2k/4k (vertical also), user selects clip type Preview, and CT 12192
 # Source SFV is of format 2k/4k, user selects any of the 3 clip types, and CT 12195",mcatande,venu001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DPSA-31352,AMSE-1619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AOMA3-2880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,,,,,"2|i3pp6k:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,A3_2025_S19,A3_2025_S20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"05/Sep/25 9:08 PM;venu001;In conversation with GMP:

And if master is associated to multiple products then it should be registered back with updated one to all those products.

 

*Applicable master type:*

Audio DDP Master ( PQ files )

*Acceptance Criteria:*

When User has AUDIO_DESCRIPTOR_FILE_EDIT permission and execute access 

and user clicks the Preview Eye icon 

Then user should be to see the EDIT button up top to the corner on the left side. ( please look below screenshot)

1) Inline editing - file should be accurate and only ISRC editing is allowed.

Edit option will be disabled until the file is not swapped and until it gets proceed. and hence a we need a message from DB to show on the UI (BE will send the flag saying Swap is progress and UI will show the message accordingly - meaning UI will show this message until BE send another flag saying it is done to let user know that file is updated.
 * New AMP asset key will be generated when users edit the PQ file and hence old AMP asset key will be replaced with New AMP asset key.
 * We need to save Old AMP asset key.
 * AMP should next make the change on isilon fast enough as they are not heavy files and request are not that many as frequently - New AOMA 3 interfaces will show the New PQ file but some AOMA 2 interfaces like A2 export or A2 DDP Descriptor will still show Old PQ file until the file gets synced by AMP.

 * ISRC warning modal window should be displayed once user clicks save button when user is trying to change the ISRC in the PQ file 
 **  Upon user clicks save button if there is ISRC mismatches we should warning modal window and if not Swap of the PQ files will get started.
 **  So SAVE Button should be enabled only when both of the two below criteria are met:

 * 
 ** 
 *** At least one change is entered from where user opened the PQ file.
 *** and ISRC format has no errors and all the ISRC entered are correct.
 * Unless a real and correct ( meaning not replacing with same ISRC or a value which is not even an ISRC ) then only the save button should be enabled
 * ISRC format validation should also be handled on UI per attached screenshot in comments and if ISRC validation fails then we should block the submit button.
 * GMP is okay to separate editing of PQ files through eye icon for different side masters of the DDP unlike legacy editor interface where everything at one place
 * Each track (trk) should have only one isrc input available (if trk has more than one idx - show input for the first idx only), 00 and AA tracks are not editable

 

!image-2025-07-01-14-31-50-023.png|width=283,height=240!

 

And the once User clicks edit Edit button should be replaced with Cancel and Save button with red and green button respectively.

SAVE button will not be enabled until and unless the ISRC which was deleted and filled back with accurate and standard no of characters which ISRC have today. 

Only ISRC edit should be given

All the rules and validations if any of AOMA 2 DDP Descriptor editing should be inherited to here.

 * Info icon for frequency drop off error should be dynamic in color ( red or yellow ) based on info from BE. 
 * Info modal window when opened both messages (Validation messages and Validation corrective action messages ) should be displayed in separate section with respective headings.
 * For ""Unexpected bandwidth"" AQC type
 ** The description ""Frequency Cutoff error""  should have info icon(red or yellow colored based on if the *Condition* is Fail with warning or Pass with warning respectively) beside to it with the below messages in the info icon window (attached the excel - Validation messages and Validation corrective action messages should be based on master type, condition ) in the icon
 ** This display of the icons color and their message inside for respective Asset type, Asset Subtype, Condition should be tested  
 ** The icon should display both Validation message and Validation suggested corrective message highlighting both problem and solution to the user.

*Dev Notes:*
 * New columns in automated_qc_notes table are as follows

*Pre-conditions:*

User is exporting Vinyl masters (16 and/or 24 bit)
 * masterTypeIds are 58 and 80
 * -Virtual support? masterTypeIds are 79 and 83- (per Rithwik's report, this was not found in PROD, so we're crossing this out)

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Gate A3 Export button behind AOMA3 EXPORT permission and proper view/execute sec group access

Destination will be ""{_}Manufacturing Plant - CES - Pallas (Germany){_}""; gate this with permission EXPORT MANUFACTURING PLANTS CES
 * Decided on 06/05/2025 refinement; we won't give this to any user and will only assign to the Admin role
 * Client Supplier ID is 20
 * !image-2025-06-05-10-11-07-487.png|width=589,height=355!

 

In UI, there should be one checkbox with Vinyl master displayed, along with a QC notes option (if available; this is a .txt file which is created if manual changes are done to QC). No need to display all the tracks associated with the Vinyl master. Display the master ID too, as we currently do on A3 Export
 * In last 6 months, only one QC file was sent to a CES plant...job is 943873. I see more traffic on non-CES destinations

 

+_Legacy display:_+

!image-2025-05-20-16-53-48-741.png|width=385,height=187!

 

+_Filenaming structure:_+

When it lands in Ci, start with {*}top folder{*}: AOMA_EXPORT_exportJobID

Send Rohit filenaming when its both PKGF and Vinyl in product

*---> Nested product folder:* ProductArtist_ProductTitle_ProductNo

*---> Vinyl master folder:* Vinyl_[16 or 24]Bit_MasterID
 * ---> ComponentNo_SideLetter/No.wav

 * 
 ** This will be a single .wav file which includes all the tracks on a single component. Duration will be displayed on details page for whole component too
 * ---> QC_Notes.txt (optional; {+}in legacy, this is outputted if the user selects the checkbox above{+})
 * *---> SCANS folder (optional)*
 ** ---> QC.[img format]; I see jpg and pdf formats so far
 *** This is the ""first"" QC file that are uploaded via the user; these are not mandatory to be uploaded, but they select an ""Add Files"" option in the DU/SU interface to upload it (see below).
 *** GMP confirmed we should keep this
 *** Example in legacy: [AOMAEXPORT_944829|https://sonymusicentertainment-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/manu_venugopal_dtg_sonymusic_com/Documents/AOMAEXPORT_944829?csf=1&web=1&e=1xb6jF] 
 * QC Notes can be on multiple components, but there is only one text file and one QC image. _Again, both are optional_
 * QC Notes should be outputted as it was registered; manual changes to QC will generate a new txt file (which user will then need to select in the interface)
 * .md5 hashes for all files
 * Example of new naming (w/o Parent Export job folder): [KRS-One_ReturnOfTheBoomBap_01241415171|https://sonymusicentertainment-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/manu_venugopal_dtg_sonymusic_com/Documents/KRS-One_ReturnOfTheBoomBap_01241415171?csf=1&web=1&e=9vctsA]

 

Export output should be the single .wav file for the side/component, as it is registered via Direct and/or Simple Upload. Details pages show tracks associated with each Component/Side, but this is not how its uploaded (it is on the user to make sure the audio they upload covers all tracks and is the right audio. AOMA does not check this).

Uploader is also required to register a wav file for each Component/Side on the product. Not doing so will block the registration submission.
 * However, after I added the same WAV file to Side B and removed it, and then clicked Submit again, it allowed the registration to go through. Does this mean not all Components/Sides can be visible on the Export UI?

!image-2025-05-28-18-41-30-004.png|width=599,height=162!

 

There is also a label copy PDF that must be included, especially for CES Exports...there is no option to add this in DU/SU. Not sure how this is generated, but BE will have to see how this is made in the legacy code. Below is PROD job 945833 to destination _Manufacturing Plant - CES - Optimal media (Germany) [Pickup]_

!image-2025-06-03-15-25-55-191.png|width=888,height=197!
 * PDFGenerationForCESExport.java in remote-export-daemon repo
 * method name: createCESPDFForExternalSuppliers
 * This will come separate from the SCANS folder and the audio files
 * This will not come for a Master-centric Export as this is called from Product data
 * {_}*07/07/2025 Sprint Planning*{_}: This should be included for PKGF Export

 

Per GMP, similar to a track/cue sheet, this PDF can indicate to the user what all tracks are on each side wav. We will need to export the WAV file, the QC (when available) and the Label Copy PDF above.

 

Email notification for Vinyl should have no changes, aside from Vinyl master being specified: [^AOMA Export 88697720841 - Fabrizio De And - Arrangiamenti P - AUDIOWAV16BITVINYLMASTER - Status DELIVERY_SUCCESSFUL.msg]

 

+_Additional tests:_+
 * Test a multi-disc product and see how this is outputting
 * Do regression test on existing A3 digital flow (WAVs, Videos, etc to Promo, Ci, DMD, etc) and PKGF flow, to make sure it is not breaking

Descriptor can be excluded, along with manifest (since {_}*10/02/2024*{_})

The SME will integrate Hive's AI Detection Technology into the SME Supply Chain in accordance with the SME Content Protection policy that forbids the dissemination of sound recordings made entirely or in part using generative AI (""GAI"") models that were not ethically trained.  

*Applicable Masters:*
Stereo Wav (16 and 24 Bit) 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

After UST changes based on the BE info passed we will display the appropriate *AI Detection* icons.

Along with display we should also give the ability to *Override* the values where users might have to override the for various reasons so the product can be full published and delivered. (Wireframe and SVG icons are attached below)

*Override AI Detection* option should be provided in ""QC Notes"" interface after *RUN AI Detection* and should only be displayed for users have this below permission:

*QC OVERRIDE AI DETECTION*

So order of Display of options in the View QC notes interface is: EDIT QC Notes. Import QC notes, RUN AQC, RUN AI Detection and Override AI Detection

Checkboxes should be provided for each track to be able to select the track(s) 

Enabling *RUN AQC* option should follow same logic as we have it now based on selection of atleast on checkbox of Failed AQC track or Null AQC track(AQC never run)

Enabling *RUN AI Detection* option should follow the logic of selection of atleast on checkbox of Failed GAI track or Null GAI track (GAI never run)

Enabling *Override AI Detection* option should follow the logic of selection of atleast on checkbox of track(S) of following *AI Detection* statuses:  Pending, Failed or Detected

 

Enabling or Disable above three options should be based on above rules and if selection of track ticks all three rules then all three options should be enabled and user should be able to use all three (no restrictions)

Similar to how currently *RUN AQC* option disables once user fires the RUN AQC for selected tracks until the AQC check from BE of that selected track is completed we should have same logic for *RUN AI Detection*

*Override AI Detection* option can be enabled back again even if user did the override for particular selected track already and wants to use the option for same track. (Override flag can be set on&off)

Checkbox should be pre-selected already when user selects all not overridden tracks and save button should be disabled until a mandatory comments is typed

Checkbox should be pre-selected when user selects all already overridden tracks but this time save button will light up only when user unselect the checkbox and enter the mandatory comments

Checkbox should be horizontal selected checkbox when user selects few overridden tracks and few not overridden tracks and this time user should either check or uncheck the checkbox completely and enter a comment to save it.

*Important Note:* BE will initiate Systematic re try or RUN AI detection for failed tracks for 5 attempts. Meaning post registration of asset and Hive AI detection is failed for a track then system will take that as pending task (so that no UI re RUN AI detection can be used) and system will re run the Hive up to 5 attempts until it not failed. If 5 attempts are unsuccessful  then system would not retry anything from BE and we will mark that track as AI detection failed and if needed later RUN AI can be initiated again from UI by users. 

Once user clicks the option *Override AI Detection* an *Override AI Detection*  named modal window should be opened as shown below (Ignore the word Edit GAI):

!image-2025-09-10-10-18-58-610.png|width=256,height=114!

Check box should be called as *Override AI Detection* and it should be pre-selected as default.

Comments box should be called as *Reason for Override* and it should allow to enter free text and mandatory and only after entering some text the save button should be enabled. This provides backtracking if anything was overridden and allowed to publish and deliver. 

Once the track(s) were overridden those track(s) should have different icon that needs to be displayed at track level on associated master section, master details page QC Notes interface (View and Edit interfaces) replacing the standard (before overriden) GAI icons.

Please find the override icons which slightly differs from normal GAI icons and the text message (bold messages below)that should be displayed on the hover over 

 

{*}AI Detection{*}{*}: Pending{*} {*}and overridden{*}- Tracks that are registered and GAI in progress - Blue Icon

{*}AI Detection{*}{*}: Failed{*} {*}and overridden{*}- Tracks that are registered but failed from GAI - Red Icon

{*}AI Detection{*}{*}: AI Detected{*} {*}and overridden{*}- Tracks that are registered and got GAI detected - Yellow/Orange Icon

 

Above written bold text should be displayed in the hover over as message for respective icons.

!image-2025-09-10-10-35-31-610.png!

 

After overriding the status of AI detection for the track(s) the GAI icon should be updated on details page (associated master section, QC notes interface and master details page)

After successful change of the status EOM message should be delivered and should update the ability to full publish and orderable in EOM (Vamsi's Kafka message is attached to XSC linked to the Epic)

Email notification should be sent out to the user about the GAI status update. (It will be phase 2)

==> you are currently only a member of the 2 Masterworks Audio/video Dropbox workspaces in the GMP Ci network, a network which is restricted to asset ingestion and internal sharing due to pre-release nature of its content
 
I have now added you to the"" Masterworks - AOMA Exports"" workspace I had set up separately for Tom Laskey to bypass the Media Box restriction to secure only as it is in the GMP Ci Network.
 
I have set up the mapping to this workspace for DA Exports and mapped your AOMA account accordingly. 
 
Please log into a fresh AOMA session, you will now be able to initiate the export to Sony Ci on your end.

*User story:* Excluding Stereo ISRC tracks from QC flows for immersive masters will also affect which tracks should be made when creating a new master hierarchy.

 

*Pre-conditions:*

User has permission QC NOTES EDIT

User has proper security group execute access

Master's track count is < product's track count
 * System will need to check if the product is an immersive or stereo one, and THEN the immersive tracks need to be identified for the comparison

Master is empty

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

[AMEBA] GRPS full publish Rules and messages for Hive AI detection,AOMA3-2922,1984860,,User Story,Merged in Stage,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,gvamsik,kori002,kori002,26/Sep/25 4:13 PM,03/Oct/25 4:50 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,,,,0,"Hello AMEBA team,

Please find the rule and messages associated to full publish capability in GRPS for Hive AI detection

*For Stereo Wav 16 and Wav 24 Bit masters:*

For regular products (where AI detection is Null or AI not detected) we should not show any messages in GRPS and allow full publish (EOM partner delivery is also allowed)

*Important Note:*
Assets swaps are allowed for full published product (usual process - We allow assets swaps in AOMA for full published products even now) and now after swap if AI is detected again on the new asset then we send the AI flag to EOM and EOM blocks the partner delivery for this track unless overridden again.. but full publish stays as full publish..

Please find the below rules and  messages for other product cases:

XX: 16 or 24

YYYYYY: Master ID

*Block full publish in GRPS until all the tracks in all the audio wav masters associated to the product are either ""AI not detected"" or ""AI detected/failed/Pending but overridden""*

 
 * *""Audio Master Wav XX Bit YYYYYY is detected with AI content for at least one track""* - Parent master level message when AI is detected but not overridden for all the detected tracks in the audio master
 * *""Audio Master WAV XX Bit YYYYYY is failed AI detection check for at least one track""* - Parent master level message when AI detection is failed and not overridden for all the failed tracks in the audio master
 * *""Audio Master WAV XX Bit YYYYYY is pending AI detection check for at least one track""* - Parent master level message when AI detection is in progress and not overridden for all the pending tracks in the audio master
 * *""Audio Master Wav XX Bit YYYYYY is detected with AI content for at least one track and overridden""* - Parent master level message when AI is detected and overridden for all the detected tracks in the audio master
 * *""Audio Master WAV XX Bit YYYYYY is failed AI detection check for at least one track and overridden""* - Parent master level message when AI detection is failed and  overridden for all the failed tracks in the audio master
 * *""Audio Master WAV XX Bit YYYYYY is pending AI detection check for at least one track and overridden""* - Parent master level message when AI detection is in progress and overridden for all the pending tracks in the audio master

Note: At parent master level messages AI detected message will take superiority over AI Detected and overridden messages

Track master level messages:
 
 * *""Audio track is detected with AI content""* - Track message when AI is detected 
 * *""Audio track is failed AI detection check""* - Track level message when AI detection is failed
 * *""Audio track is pending AI detection check""* - Track level message when AI detection is in progress
 * *""Audio track is detected with AI content and overridden""* - Track message when AI is detected and overridden
 * *""Audio track is failed AI detection check and overridden""* - Track level message when AI detection is failed and overridden

I'm working on a project to help develop a download button in the GOLD app, so that we can migrate some of AOMA's Export Order form traffic over to using it instead...ultimately, this will help the overall goal of killing the A2 Export Order form altogether.

For this, I need to see how certain products/Orders were fulfilled in AOMA and if there was any strange situation where it was NOT fulfilled, order didn't go through, etc. Attached are 2 reports from GOLD, of different requests from their end; one is for single-use/track requests, and the other is for Compilation products.

For the first/single use Excel, please look at the ISRC column in it, and supply me a report of the following:
 * The Product No's associated with the ISRC (refer to _*Column F/Asset Number for the ISRC)*_
 ** There is one blank entry here, whose title is *The Photographer, ""A Gentleman's Honour""* (look for blank entry in Column F)...do a search for the title in this case, to get possible Product No's
 * Any Export Orders associated with these Product No's (different from Export Job ID's)
 * Status of Export Order (whether these Export Orders were fulfilled or not)
 * Master types and IDs associated with these Export Orders (track master ID and track ISRC also included, if possible)
 * Export Order requestor
 * Maintenance Owner
 * Export Job ID
 * Export Job submitter

 

For the 2nd Excel/Compilations one, please provide the same as above in a 2nd sheet. The Product No is already listed in Column I.
 * If you do not find any Export Order associated with this Compilation product, please instead do a search for associated Product No's on the ISRC's listed in Column M, and repeat the same criteria as above. The criteria in this case would be the same, as above for track/single-use...only difference is using Column F in one Excel, and Column M in the other.

 

Also, on a separate note/question: are there cases of track masters in AOMA having a null ISRC? I know that product ISRCs can sometimes be null because of the product being created in a rush (in GRPS), but just curious if its the same with master ISRC's as well. We're looking to send ISRCs accordingly to GOLD for this proposed download flow, so this would be good information for me to know.

The SME will integrate Hive's AI Detection Technology into the SME Supply Chain in accordance with the SME Content Protection policy that forbids the dissemination of sound recordings made entirely or in part using generative AI (""GAI"") models that were not ethically trained.  

*Applicable Masters:*
Stereo Wav (16 and 24 Bit) - Highest priority 

Other masters which has audio in it will eventually also be the scope of this project

*Project High level:*
**
 # GAI scans will be conducted when new tracks are first uploaded into the AOMA, before they go live. When Hive identifies a track as being GAI, the product(s) will be flagged in the system and placed on ""hold."" 
 # A note will be generated by the system to be shared with the SME label or affiliate. The SME label or affiliate is required to review all flagged products before any further action is taken in the system.
 # Once the SME label or affiliate reviews and approves, the content can be set to Full published and can be delivered.

*Phases:*
Phase 1

1) All Stereo audio registrations via UST should undergo GAI Scan. UST BE changes are required and  System wide capability to turn on/off the GAI scan from BE to avoid multiple GAI scan failures in case of Hive API is down. Including Email notification, EOM message delivery and master event history update. 

2) GAI badge in separate column (writing based on discussion with Nelson) should be displayed on track (Product and Associated Master section, QC Notes interface and Master details page)

3) Ability to modify the GAI status or Ignore GAI  on Edit QC notes interface (inline and bulk edit) to allow publishing and delivery of product 

4) Ability to RUN GAI for failed tracks/ tracks that were never run ( No backfill of GAI for older products will be done as of now)

Immersive Master (Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby, 360 RA).

Short Form Video Master

Closed Caption Master (SCC and TTML)

*Acceptance Criteria:*
For above masters we should be able to edit the Lyric indicator at track master level using the same pencil icon that we have today for ISRC edit. 

We should give the ability to edit the lyric in the same modal window when Pencil icon is clicked

The last option in the modal window should be given to be able to edit lyric indicator 

Drop Down should be called as ""Lyric Indicator"" and it should be set default to current version of track.

Then rest of the options should be provided in the drop down to be able to edit the lyric indicator of the track master.

 

Three values will be provided in the Dropdown: Explicit, Clean and Unknown. (BE will pass as values)

User can change to any value from one value among above values.

After successful edit E indicator or EMismatch indicator display on details page and on QC notes interface should be properly adjusted based on the value it got modified to.

Similar to ISRC Edit we should be giving warning if the track master is linked to different other products and changing the version here will create the mismatch between the current product and all other products.

Migrate the AOMA architecture for Physical Supply Chain including AOMA 2 export component to AOMA 3 ,AOMA3-2838,1947244,,Epic,To Do,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,kori002,kori002,kori002,24/Jul/25 2:10 AM,01/Oct/25 5:11 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,,,,0,"*Back Ground:* 

CES Export:

There are two workflows based on who registers the Physical's ( Vinyl, PKGF, DDP. Blu-ray, DVD). There are European registration users and there are US based registration users and hence the two workflows.

EU: If a person is subscribed for auto export to the CES destination, and registers a physical master in AOMA and then AOMA sends an export message to CMG system automatically

US: US releases might depend if the US stuff is getting manufactured and releasing in EU or not. They can use Auto export as same as EU folks does or they can use AOMA 2 Supply chain order form to export to CES destination.

For any workflow the XML message is generated and sent to CMG system  with Master ID, Product Number and Export Key. 

And when they are ready to manufacture CMG system sends an XML based request to export to a particular destination. and the message consists of Product ID, export key and Vendor ID/Client ID and the Export message is consumed by AOMA 2 and an export request is created for that product number, master id (which is represented by export key) and AOMA 2 export destination (that corresponds to Client Supplier ID)

So the destination is SFTP server and it packages everything and delivers to that location and this location is accessed by the client and they get the part order that they have to manufacture

 

Following are couple of initial agenda items (phases):

Phase 1: Along with AOMA 2 queue the CMG export request should also be consumed by AOMA 3 queue. 

We should check if certain destination pertaining to Client supplier ID is available in AOMA 2 and AOMA 3 and whether they are active or not.

*Case 1:* If both AOMA 2 and AOMA 3 destination are active, then AOMA 2 export is submitted and then message is also forwarded to AOMA 3 to submit a parallel export via AOMA 3. This is for temporary and this way they would receive the packages from both and would help us confirm both look accurate and same to make us AOMA 2 destination inactive in near future post confirmation.

 

*Case 2:* If AOMA 2 is disabled and only AOMA 3 is active, then we should just forward the message to AOMA 3 to consume and send the export to the destination.

 

*Case 3:* If AOMA 2 is active and AOMA 3 is not available/active, then just export via AOMA 2 and do not submit any message to AOMA 3.

 

Phase 2: 
We should work on messages only being directed to AOMA 3 queue once deliveries from AOMA 2 and AOMA 3 are confirmed as same.

 

Phase 3: Current AOMA 3 Physical supply chain order form dashboard should be revisited to make the interface more faster and add new destinations as we have in AOMA 2 supply chain order interface.

AOMA home page needs to be updated to Angular, because the system needs to be on the same framework and development platform across all interfaces. 

A request from business is to slightly the change the look and feel of the AOMA home page to meet the modern standards. 

 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

Upgrade the AOMA home page to angular

There should be no role displayed on the Home page such as Media Engineer, or Audio Engineer or Graphics Engineer etc..

The interface buttons on the landing page should be more interactive like reacting to mouse hover over by slightly enlarging and highlighted little darker on the border as shown below.

 

The reference documents links should be cleaned up - all the obsolete ones need to be removed. There are total 36 links now in AOMA home page if user has permission to all the links. Please find the attached excel to see what are all the links should be removed and what are all the links should be renamed. 

Reference documents should be placed down in the Home page in categories in rectangular shape with curved corners and those categories should also match with home page buttons design meaning the color, font, boldness, reacting to hover over and it should be modern UX.

[AOMA Home Page - Reference Documents.xlsx|https://sonymusicentertainment-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/rithwikreddy_koripelly_ext_sonymusic_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC706A05D-45DE-4A49-97AB-A6A6B45B8F56%7D&file=AOMA%20Home%20Page%20-%20Reference%20Documents.xlsx&fromShare=true&action=default&mobileredirect=true]

Reference documents should be categorized into below categories:

*GRAPHICS*
*AUDIO*
*VIDEO*
*LINKING* 

Each category has sub category like including General sub category.

 

The good thing about current buttons we have on the AOMA home page is the readability so we shall increase the font size a bit and make the font bolder. (Short description can be ignored for now - we do not need that) and hence all the buttons will be in square shaped.

!image-2025-07-02-16-22-47-440.png!

!image-2025-07-02-16-23-40-557.png!

 

Home page will have 4 rows 5 buttons each. Total 20 buttons. 

Default order is below if user have access or permission to all 20 options. Display of Some of these (if not all) buttons will be decided base on the role and permissions that user have. If any of the option from the order misses out due to lack of permissions then the order should be followed to the next available option in the list.

In addition to default view we should also provide drag and adjust capabilities of these buttons so that user can customize of what they want to see in Row 1, Row 2 etc...  

We should also provide option of Hiding and Unhide options based on user preference.

AOMA3 Linking - To link multiple masters in one action - Track Master Linking ,AOMA3-2794,1921401,,User Story,To Do,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,,kori002,kori002,09/Jun/25 7:20 PM,29/Sep/25 5:09 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,,,,0,"*User Story:* Currently a user is only able to commit one master type at a time via the track linking interface. The ability to multi-select and commit multiple track master links in one step has been requested.  This will increase efficiency and cut down on the time to link from one product to another significantly. 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 
In track linking interface we should make Audio and Video master types multi select i.e we should provide check boxes against each master type.

!image-2025-06-17-22-15-27-452.png|width=227,height=238!
Once user selects one or more master type and hit fetch masters we should display each master type selected in the order of Prod Seq and Prod Track Seq.

One *Master Type* col along with a filter dropdown at column level (to filter and apply the master types) should be added in between Master Track Seq col and Master Icons col. 

Example: Product has 1 side 4 tracks and user selected Wav 16 Bit + DDP, WAV 24 Bit (44.1kHz) and Dolby Atmos 

then we should show total 12 tracks with Row 1 displaying Track 1 and Wav 16 Bit +DDP info, Row 2 displaying Track 1 and Wav 24 Bit (44.1 kHz), Row 3 displaying Track 1 and Dolby Atmos and Row 4 displaying Track 2 and Wav 16 Bit +DDP info and so on.... ( this order applies even a particular combination does not fetch any master level info and no ISRC match is found)

Filter dropdown at Master Type col will be used if user wants to see filtered view of only particular master type.
!image-2025-06-17-22-15-51-064.png|width=498,height=130!




If when multiple masters are linked in one action and we need to consolidate all the error(s) to show in one single modal window and if no errors popped up then users are redirected to warnings modal window. 

*Warnings*  *Display:* 

 We shall display warnings in one single with extended modal window.

**

With August Build we have released the GIF submission for pseudo video creation.

Currently AOMA allows only digital video track products with footage type ""Still Pseudo video"" to be submitted for auto-pseudo generation. GIF submitted images have motion, so the appropriate footage type is ""Enhance Pseudo video"" -

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Update "" Still Pseudo video"" footage type for jpeg only based auto-pseudo video submission.

Enable ""Enhance Pseudo video""  footage type for gif only based auto-pseudo submission.  

*Test:*

Test if ""Enhance Pseudo video""  footage type digital video track product is allowed for Pseudo video submission by using gif only but not using jpeg file

Test if ""Still Pseudo video""  footage type digital video track product is allowed for Pseudo video submission by using jpeg only but not using gif

As discussed, We are building a functionality in AOMA3 to process the physical exports to manufacturing plant (CES).
To achieve this, we need to receive update events from the tickets table. We need to know when the status of a ticket changes to TicketStatus.Of.INPROGRESS.
Columns are:
ticket_ky
ticket_type
ticket_status
data
message
client_system_id

The app that will access this event is aoma-export-service. Roles are below:

As a user I want to  to create a Pseudo video using AOMA with ease by pre populating the product numbers of digital video track based on selected audio track related audio ISRC

*Description:* 

Currently, AOMA pseudo video interface has to be manually updated with digital video track products after selecting the Audio tracks and cover image from details page

*Acceptance Criteria:*

When the user navigates to the Pseudo interface via the product details page they  will select cover and all the tracks of audio requires for pseudo video creation and then click the pseudo video button to open the interface with the cover art and audio from that product prepopulated. 

We should use related audio ISRC concept here to auto populate the digital video track products where those video track product ISRCS relates to audio track by related audio ISRC

On clicking the pseudo video button from the details interface the pseudo video create interface loads including suggested product IDs which should be review-able/modifiable by the user before committing/submitting.

We should provide give the ability to change the product number if user wants and also we should give ability to navigate quickly to details page of the product using product number hyperlinks that are pre populated.

*Test Cases:*

Stereo Audio (16 Bit, 24 Bit and vinyl), Immersive, SFV, CC. 

*Description:*

*Request from business is to show explicit indicators at track level on master details page, QC Notes and Associated master section interface.*

Currently the indicator is not inherited at the master level and as a result, it is not viewable in the A3 master details or Qc notes interfaces as these leverage master data and are master level vs. product level.  

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

To add the explicit indicator at the master level, upon association with product data (similar to ISRC inheritance). 
 * A3 product Details 
 * A3 Master Details 
 * QC Notes 

Que for GMP? Shall we consider regs thru Simple & direct upload or only UST?

Phase 1- UST regs are inheriting (potentially do it for everything) - Stereo Audio, SFV, VSC,  VCA and Immersive and displaying the indicator wherever we have the ISRC - like at Assoc master section, Master details page, QC Notes and mismatches of explicit indicators should be shown on products tracks tab

Phase 2 - Backfill for all the prodcuts ( can be done in phases) - This should be done as 2nd phase and ahead of linking interface cz we need to have these info for older products in order to support when linking is performed.

Phase 3 -  Product linking - anytime we fetch pretty similar to duration and isrc mismatches are shown and linking inheritance - master does not have E and product has E then it inherits 

Phase 4 - Track master edit - allows you to change the explicit/non-explicit and with warnings similar to ISRc edit

As a user I want to upload a .gif image to create a Pseudo video using AOMA.

*Description:* 

Currently, AOMA pseudo video supports image as source or uploads of type .jpg or .jpeg and .gif 

*Acceptance Criteria:*
UI should allow .gif file with following restrictions:
If file type gif is submitted
 * Image dimensions must be 1920x1080 or 1080x1080
 * Framerate must be 25fps 
 * File size should not exceed 400mb

Other UI validations we already have for gif based submission are:

No dots and spaces inside the file name and height validation 

CT id for accepting non gif file: 2067

CT id for accepting .gif file: 4205

 

*IMP:* Should loop in GMP and users like Victor while changes in stage before we push changes to prod.

*Test Cases:*
General regression testing should be conducted for Pseudo video creation using Source audio and source cover or upload of cover

Auto QC lock and Auto QC approval should also be tested for jpeg and gif uploads.

Pseudo Video created using .gif source should undergo registration using UST to create SFV and VSC master under digital video track of footage type ""Enhanced Pseudo Video""

AOMA should work on displaying indicators and mismatch info on during linking on linking interfaces (full and track linking interfaces) and on warning modal window same as ISRC.

*Applicable Masters:* 

Stereo Audio Wav Master (16 Bit, 24 Bit and Vinyls)

Immersive Master (Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby, 360 RA).

Short Form Video Master

Closed Caption Master (SCC and TTML)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

BE will pass below lyric indicator values for the track master when explicit flag is True or false but not null

Explicit

Clean

Unknown

So based on the values to the version values:

When we try fetch and commit link for above masters we should display the information regarding E and EMismatch indicator next to product title as we do it products tracks tab as per below cases:

Case 1:

If both product track and track master is Explicit we display E indicator next to title text on track level - No warning will be displayed on modal window

Case 2:

If both product track and track master is clean or unknown we do not display any badge or E indicator on linking interface - No warning will be displayed on modal window

Case 3:

If explicit flag  on the track master and the product track is not matched then we show the show the EMismatch indicator with hover over pop up showing version of product track and track master and in the warning modal window in the section of duration and ISRC mismatches another column should be added to show the tracks which has Explicit version mismatch.

Like example below when Product Track is Clean and Track master is explicit.

example when product track is Unknown and Track master is explicit.

Sky blue color is used here but same color should be maintained as compared to how we have for Duration mismatches (Dark Blue)

(360 RA was already implemented this change with earlier ticket in Aug build but BE changes (UST inheritance part was not available at that time and hence our display of indicators and mismatches was not showing anything for 360 - Matt C will push BE changes for Sept build so if we need to do any change after his push then 360 RA will also be in scope for this one)

Hence this ticket will be Dependent upon UST team support inheriting explicit indicators on to track level for SCC, TTML.

Also since now BE is gonna pass the values of lyric indicator version to the UI. UI should consider those values to display the E and Emismatch indicators on various pages(Products tab, Associated master section, QC Notes and Master details page) as per below mentioned logic for all the below master in scope to maintain the consistency in logic for all the masters that were done previously in Aug build.

Stereo Audio Wav Master (16 Bit, 24 Bit and Vinyls)

Immersive Master (Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby, 360 RA).

Short Form Video Master

Closed Caption Master (SCC and TTML)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

BE will pass below lyric indicator values for the track master when explicit flag is True or false but not null

Explicit

Clean

Unknown

 

and Currently the explicit mismatch badge should show hover over message as described/displayed (similar pop over message as we have for duration mismatches) instead of hover messages in black/gray boxes. 

This should be again applied to all the masters in scope:

So for SFV, Immersive, Stereo Audio (16, 24 and Vinyl's) and including CC (SCC and TTML).

 
 * Explicit indicators should be displayed at track master level on
 ** Associated master section
 ** Master details page
 * Explicit indicator mismatches should be displayed on products tab and QC notes interface by following below mentioned cases:
 ** QC noter interface
 *** When QC notes is accessed through UST or Assoc master section we should show the Explicit mismatches based underlying product
 *** When QC notes is accessed through master details page E indicator alone is fine to display for the track master
 ** Products tab (follow the below cases)

 

Case 1:

If both product track and track master is Explicit we display E indicator next to title text on track level on products tab and associated master section.

Case 2:

If both product track and track master is clean or unknown we do not display anything.

Case 3:

If lyric indicator values on the track master and the product track is not matched then we show the show the EMismatch indicator with hover over pop up showing version of product track and track master on products tab.

Like example below when Product Track is Clean and Track master is explicit.

example when product track is Unknown and Track master is explicit.

Half scope of the ticket involves testing similar to test happened for this ticket last build i.e in this build we have extended the display of Explicit indicators and mismatches on details page and QC notes interface  to CC (SCC and TTML) and 360 RA masters https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/AOMA3-2703

Another half of the scope is change style of display of Explicit mismatches (Similar style to duration mismatches on products tab etc) 0 This should be tested for all masters in scope for this project i.e last build ticket and this build ticket (Below)
SFV, Stereo Audio (16 and 24) and Vinyl Audio (16 and 24), Immersive(Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby, 360 RA). CC (SCC and TTML) 

 

 ;;;","17/Sep/25 9:54 PM;jpitzer;*Verified in STAGE*



*Applicable Masters:* Closed Captions (SCC and TTML) and 360 RA

(360 RA was already implemented this change with earlier ticket in Aug build but BE changes (UST inheritance part was not available at that time and hence our display of indicators and mismatches was not showing anything for 360 - Matt C will push BE changes for Sept build so if we need to do any change after his push then 360 RA will also be in scope for this one)

Hence this ticket will be Dependent upon UST team support inheriting explicit indicators on to track level for SCC, TTML.

Also since now BE is gonna pass the values of lyric indicator version to the UI. UI should consider those values to display the E and Emismatch indicators on various pages(Products tab, Associated master section, QC Notes and Master details page) as per below mentioned logic for all the below master in scope to maintain the consistency in logic for all the masters that were done previously in Aug build.

Stereo Audio Wav Master (16 Bit, 24 Bit and Vinyls)

Immersive Master (Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby, 360 RA).

Short Form Video Master

Closed Caption Master (SCC and TTML)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

BE will pass below lyric indicator values for the track master when explicit flag is True or false but not null

Explicit

Clean

Unknown

 

and Currently the explicit mismatch badge should show hover over message as described/displayed (similar pop over message as we have for duration mismatches) instead of hover messages in black/gray boxes. 

This should be again applied to all the masters in scope:

So for SFV, Immersive, Stereo Audio (16, 24 and Vinyl's) and including CC (SCC and TTML).

 
 * Explicit indicators should be displayed at track master level on
 ** Associated master section
 ** Master details page
 * Explicit indicator mismatches should be displayed on products tab and QC notes interface by following below mentioned cases:
 ** QC noter interface
 *** When QC notes is accessed through UST or Assoc master section we should show the Explicit mismatches based underlying product
 *** When QC notes is accessed through master details page E indicator alone is fine to display for the track master
 ** Products tab (follow the below cases)

 

*Case 1:*

If both product track and track master is Explicit we display E indicator next to title text on track level on products tab and associated master section.{*}>>PASS{*}

The goal here is similar to ISRC inheritance when a master first linked to product it should inherit the lyric indicator version to it's track based on product track version. 
We can skip this inheritance for Mobile product configurations for now 

and also we should test if track master already has some lyric indicator version and it is not overriding that value upon linking to the product. Essentially it should inherit only when the track master has lyric indicator value as ""Null"" meanaing when it is getting first time linked after master created using master only as example shown below.

Display of mismatches on linking interface is handled as part of different ticket ;;;","16/Sep/25 10:26 PM;jpitzer;Verified in STAGE

Currently we do not support PV registration for Virtual Master (Side DDP/Blu-ray/DVD) . We support for all Virtual Track masters and we cannot support this one for any Virtual Side Vinyl masters.

*Applicable Masters:*
Virtual Master (Side DDP/Blu-ray/DVD)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

To support Virtual Master (Side DDP/Blu-ray/DVD) for PV generation.

It should display Virtual master id with side and track seq listed. (As discussed it is okay to display the Virtual master id, Side and track seq of virtual master as supposed to display of underlying parent source master id. We display the track title info in the icon for user to understand what audio it is)

*Test cases;*

Create a Virtual Master (Side DDP/Blu-ray/DVD) with multiple tracks where tracks are created from multiple different parent source masters. Example Track 1 side ! of Virtual master should be from Track 5 of Parent source master (try to jumble up) and create as many virtual tracks as possible in that manner for the virtual master

Now select all the tracks in the virtual master and create multiple Pseudo video products to verify if the correct parent source audio master is mapped to Pseudo video created via Virtual track master.

Standard PV regression test like Auto Lock, Auto Approval and VSC extraction.

As a user, I want to see the specific immersive related ISRC for each immersive track when I click on the QC Notes section, so that I can verify the correct ISRC information for immersive content.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I am on the Associated Masters section for an stereo/immersive product
*WHEN* I click on the QC Notes button option
*AND* track has both immersive related ISRC and stereo ISRC
*THEN* each track should display the specific immersive related ISRC instead of the stereo ISRC -if the related ISRC is available for that specific immersive track- (crossed out due to AND statement above).

 

+*User Story 2:* Do not display immersive tracks in QC when no Immersive related ISRC is available+
As a user, I want to -see an empty field for related ISRC when an- hide immersive tracks which do not have a corresponding immersive related ISRC, so that I can easily identify which tracks lack the related ISRC.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
*GIVEN* I am on the Associated Masters tab for an stereo/immersive product
*WHEN* a track does not have a related immersive ISRC
*THEN* -the ISRC field for that track should be empty.- that particular track should not be displayed for QC Note editing (confirmed on GMP call on 6/23)

 

-In addition to above QC changes, display ""encoding type"" for Atmos on Product Tracks section (example below)- (Determined we can do this later per 9/2 Sprint planning, so scratching this out)
 * -This display should be track-based, not product config-based (per Rohit on 07/08 call)-
 * -This should only show for immersive products-

!image-2025-07-08-12-04-55-872.png|width=932,height=61!

 

+_Per above and below notes, stereo ISRC should NEVER display for an immersive track in QC going forward_+
 * 9/17/2025: Dolby ISRCs should be compared to performance ISRCs, and Stereo ISRCs should be compared to Stereo ones...there should be no overlapping between the 2 from a direct comparison standpoint

 

Lets also test this in UST

*{color:#ff0000}Requirements which needs to be checked with Rohit and story needs to be updated:{color}*

{color:#ff0000}If a product has 5 tracks and if only 3 tracks  has related ISRC and if we click on the QC Notes button from one of the immersive master section,{color}

{color:#ff0000} should we display all the 5 tracks and grey out the 2 tracks which does not have the related ISRC or should we only display the 3 tracks which has the related ISRC ?{color}

{color:#00875a}Checked the above with Rohit on 6/4/2025, Rohit asked us to check with Mike, Checked with Mike on 6/4/2025 and Mike said though UST is displaying all the tracks, on the QC notes section we can display only the tracks which has the related ISRC. eg. if a product has 5 tracks and only 2 relates ISRC is available, UST will display all the 5 tracks where only 2 tracks will have the file name & ISRC and the select button enabled but for the remaining 3 tracks it would be greyed out, But on the QC Notes section we should be displaying only the 2 tracks which has the related ISRC {color}

 

{*}Notes From Refinement 6/5/{*}2025

{color:#172b4d}QA needs to get the following test products from prod & stage:{color}

 # album stereo products & corresponding dolby product(But only for few tracks)

Multiple jpeg submissions for pseudo video creation throws an error,AOMA3-2889,1970275,,Issue,Done,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,Done,kori002,kori002,kori002,02/Sep/25 11:26 PM,18/Sep/25 8:46 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,10/Sep/25 5:26 PM,,AOMA-2.114.0,,,0,"*Description:*

Based on linked DPSA it seems like when we submit multiple entries of Pseudo video jobs it is throwing an error and hence the pseudo videos are not getting created.

I have replicated this issue in Stage by take 5 video track products (footage type: Still pseudo video) and submitted the cover image that was given in the DPSA and it has thrown below error.

Work around of clearing cache is working sometimes but it keeps popping up agian.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
Pseudo video creation should not throw any error regardless of any amount of jobs submitted simultaneously that may be one same image or different images for different jobs

 Test Products in Stage:
G0100034971354
G0100036483946
G0100029535434
G0100019618088
G010001968390R
G010001818975W

This should be tested for both Jpeg and gif submissions separately and should not throw error for any number of jobs submitted.

To mitigate the risk of this happening again we're proposing the following:

 

*Pre - Conditions:* 
 * SFV - QC Lock is a must (regardless of whether or not an actual QC note was entered)
 * Immersive - QC Lock is a must (regardless of whether or not an actual QC note was entered)
 * Stereo Audio (DDP, Wav 16 and Wav 24b) - If the QC notes are entered, QC lock is must However, if the QC notes are not entered, QC lock is not required

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As shown in the image attached add ""{*}QC Lock?"" column{*} in the table that comes when we click ""show all matches"" icon beside master.

As shown in the image attached *""Highlight the master in Red both at commit link page and all matches' page if the QC is not locked for SFV and Immersive Master types and for Stereo Audio follow the QC available and lock combination logic and with a info icon beside that red master to see the details. QC Available - Y/N QC Lock - Y/N* 

Logic for Sorting Masters is as follows:

For Track Link Fetch: Use QC lock as first level of sorting for SFV and Immersive and then most recent registration date

For Track Link Fetch: Wav 16/DDP, Wav 16 should be given first preference over DDP (existing behavior), then second level sorting is QC lock / QC not entered at all, and then most recent registration date

For Wav 24b, first level sorting is QC lock / QC not entered at all, and then most recent registration date

 

 

 


Comment for (Sharma, Himanshu ), we should make the sorting as generic as possible for other master types as well e.g. VSC OR CC etc, if they don't have QC lock at all, then secondary sorting should handle the current use case (most recently registered). Discuss with Rohit if needed.
Stage testing for sergi posted tickets

On Commit, there should be a secondary warning for these master types indicating to user that QC notes are not locked 
 * SFV and Immersive audio - Require QC and QC lock - If not locked, on linking, a warning should indicate that the asset is not QC locked and will not be deliverable until locked. (Use this warning message:  {*}Asset is not QC locked and will not be deliverable until locked{*}.) 
 * Stereo Audio - Does not require QC lock except when QC notes exist.  If QC notes exist there should be a similar warning message if not locked. (

 ** *For Harshita:* QC Locking in AOMA also affects downstream apps like EOM. When this happens, data is sent to EOM accordingly. When we first implemented immersive, we had to do testing to make sure that flag is being sent right...this required an XSC. This would be primarily testing with Prashant/Manuela, and Minoshi handled this when with immersives.
 ** +_assetAvailability_+ needs to be checked as well
 * Internal review should happen with GMP too, about this requirement (check with Harshita if this is done yet)

 

*Business Value:* As the user I would like to see the information and data for a Track even when the information for a master may be incomplete so that I can provide QC Testing and Notes for a given track without having to depend on other components of a master's availability - currently, I cannot do that. 

 

*Description:* We would like to provide the same workflow process for track level information immersive type masters to the audio masters, namely WAV16, WAV24, and DSD

 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

Given the user is working with a WAV16, WAV24, or DSD Master type

When there are one or more tracks available for the master

Then the ability to add QC Notes will appear on the track level, like it does for immersive masters
 * Copy AC from immersive tickets here for more specific instructions for dev; or use AOMA3-2245 and AOMA3-2279 as Harshita already made

And these changes should be reflected on UST, so that this information from the Associated Masters Tab is coming in from the individual track level there as well
 * UST has shared component with respect to QC Notes
 * Is UST setting default QC Notes on registration? If so, they need to accomodate this change, and there would be a ticket needed on their side
 * Is WAV/DDP ready in UST? That would impact this as well

These are needed to download an SFV in UST so we should add these accordingly on the A3 details page.

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Given the AOMA user is workings with a Closed Caption or Subtitle type asset in AOMA 3

When they are on the Associated Masters Tab viewing the asset

Then they will be able to download the asset(s) using the HTTP Download option

And this will be available for SCC and TTML Closed Captions

And the download option will also be available for the the Subtitles

And there will be proper tracking of the downloads for the assets using the Master Event History

And there will be email notification sent the user when they initiate a download for the asset they are working with

 

Note: We will not need an Aspera option for downloading the SCC on the A3 side - but we will need Aspera download abilities on the UST side. We may need to modify this in the future.

 ** How would we get Side Letter, if we are displaying this on the Associated Masters Section? It does not display there, as you see in above screenshots. Would we have to add it on the Product tab? There are also different file-naming conventions between Product and Master.
 ** Are we doing preview download along with source download? If so, what CT needs to be used? As an example, SFV clip downloads use CTs

At present, product data is required for both the master details page and the related master section on the product details.

Since the master might exist independently of a product association, the master-centric interfaces should ideally not depend on any product at all.

Could you please identify these dependencies in terms of BE and UI? I'll open a new ticket to correct this implementation (i.e., eliminate product dependencies) based on this analysis.

First off, I'm not entirely sure this is in stage yet

 

I'm also wondering about the permission EXPORT AUDIO PRE RELEASE and if it pertains to this ticket

 

Example product is G010000582042Y>>Product is pre-release and has AOMA INT and Argentina assigned

User lily752 has both those SGs assigned with View and Execute released, view pre-release

 

If user has permission Export Audio Pre-release and doesn't have execute access, THEN the A2 export button is available, the A2 export UI opens, but no masters are available for export

 

If user doesn't have Export Audio Pre-release THEN A2 export button doesn't display.

 

So I feel like this needs to be addressed in the ticket. I've assigned it back to you;;;","23/Jul/24 8:42 PM;venu001;[~jpitzer] 

Spoke with Rohit and Kiran on this; so the failure is not valid as this is existing logic for the A2 Export button and UI currently. We'll refine this on the linked A3 ticket, but Rohit did mention we can get rid of the Pre Release permission going forward; lets keep it for now and use this as a test case in tonight's build.

As discussed over a call UST using a bulk script to import/lock qc notes by calling AOMA3 endpoints.

[DB] ISRC Backfill for auto-fetch track linking support,AOMA3-1236,1337248,,User Story,Done,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,Done,vank001,venu001,venu001,08/Nov/22 3:56 PM,18/Sep/25 7:43 AM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,18/May/23 4:03 PM,,AOMA 2.107.0,,,0,"Hi DB team,

AOMA has been developing a new track linking function that auto-fetches available masters for a give ISRC and mater type.

As part of the phase 1, the following masters are in scope:
 * DDP
 * 16 WAV bit
 * 24 WAV bit

The key to success of this auto fetch feature is the correctness of the backend data especially the ISRC at track master level.

Can you please generate a report for the above mentioned masters that have registered assets but the ISRC on track master level does not match any of the associated product tracks.

e.g. If wav 16b master has 5 sub track level masters with registered assets:

TM 1 -> ISRC: XYZ1 (Linked to Product 1 and Product 2 with same ISRC on product track level)

TM2 -> ISRC: XYZ2 (Linked to Product 1 and Product 2 with same ISRC on product track level)

TM3 -> ISRC: XYZ3 (Linked to Product 1 and Product 2 with same ISRC on product track level)

TM4 -> ISRC: XYZ4 (Linked to Product 1 with same ISRC ABC1 and Product 2 with ISRC ABC2 on product track level)

TM5 -> ISRC: Null (Linked to Product 1 and Product 2 with same ISRC: XYZ5 on product track level)

For the case above, this report should have the following for TM4 and TM5

Track Master Id

Track Master Title

Asset Duration

Track Master ISRC

Product Track Link Creation Date

Product Track Link Last Updated Date

Product Parent Level Link type (Full master vs Virtual)

Product Track Title

Product Track Duration

Product Track ISRC 

Product Number

Product Title

Product Title Supplement

Product Artist

Product Configuration

Product Release Date

Product Parent Rep Owner

Even if the connection is encrypted with TLS there are still some risks.In general, the use of HTTP Basic Auth should not be considered secure, especially for critical systems, since it has a few security flaws, such as: - The password is sent over the wire in base64 encoding (which can be easily converted to plaintext); - The password is sent repeatedly, for each request (larger attack window); - The password is cached by the web browser, at a minimum for the length of the window/process (can be silently reused by any other request to the server, e.g. CSRF); - The password may be stored permanently in the browser, if the user requests (same as previous point, in addition might be stolen by another user on a shared machine);Of these flaws, using SSL only prevents the first, and even with that, SSL only protects until the webserver, any internal routing, server logging, etc, will see the plaintext password.We would advise to review the need and justification of using this authentication method, consider using a more secure method such as OpenID or others.

With this high load the A3 details page becomes unresponsive as we need to fetch the data for all the tracks when the page loads. To work with these products, we should expand the queries to return data for few sides at a time rather than all. Below are the modifications required in the query:

1. Write a new query 'productSides'. This query takes in product as input and returns the product sides and the product side links for each side. Add necessary columns from both product_sides and product_side_links table.

2. Extend the existing getProductTrackDetails query to take a list of product sides(optional) as input along with product. The query should return all the tracks in case the product sides is empty (current logic remains as is). In case the input contains a list of product sides, then the query should return the track data only for these particular sides.

 * *Import from immersive to non-immersive audio*
 ** Can we delete the existing error message, that Product or Master No is not of Immersive Audio type, so its not allowed?
 * *Import from non-immersive to immersive audio*
 ** Keep the existing validations (e.g. number of track masters are identical on both masters, etc)
 ** Carry these 3 fields from the Header to track master level of destination master:
 *** QC Engineer
 *** Last Updated By
 *** QC Comments

 * *Import from non-immersive to non-immersive*
 ** Validate that track length of each product/master is the same; throw error message ""Track length of products don't match"" if not the same
 ** Map track placement accordingly and carry over the same 3 fields mentioned above
 *** *ex:* If importing from Product B to Product A, and both have track lengths of 5, then the track at Side 1, Seq 1 in Product A will inherit the QC Notes of the track at Side 1, Seq 1 in Product B...and so on

In current day, a bunch of media assets are now digital and thus use a digital order management workflow (this involves products being created and sent to Digital Service Providers).

However, there are still older, legacy physical products that need to be distributed as well. This uses physical workflow. We should figure out a way to streamline/modernize this process as much as possible, as there are many different orders that can be done (involving a bunch of Export Orders, certain order forms, etc)

GRPS is heavily involved here, as they are the entry point of the workflow and precede AOMA. Not only do we receive metadata from them, but GRPS creates scheduling orders in AOMA, where then we proceed to export these media assets to manufacturing plants.

[DB] Create user_home_page_preference_map table,AOMA3-2835,1945872,1910237,Sub-task,Merged in Dev,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,stef003,stef003,stef003,22/Jul/25 12:47 PM,16/Sep/25 8:45 AM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,AOMA-2.115.0,,,0,"Hi DB team,

The aoma application is developing a new home page dashboard and needs database support to store user-specific tile configurations. Tiles are menu options on the dashboard that users can reorder and show/hide.

We plan to reuse the *_aoma_ui_menu_options_* table for base tile information (name, URL, permissions).

Please do the following:

 

*1. Extend _aoma_ui_menu_options_* *table*
    Please add the following columns to the aoma.{_}aoma_ui_menu_options{_} table:

    {_}is_tile{_}: BOOLEAN (NOT NULL, default false)
    {_}description{_}: VARCHAR(255) (NULL)
    {_}default_order{_}: SMALLINT (NULL)
    {_}icon_name{_}: VARCHAR(255) (NULL)

    *Data backfill:* Please backfill these new columns for provided options and update _aoma_ui_menu_option_nm_ for existing records based on the attached XLS file.

 

*2. Add new option to* _*aoma_ui_menu_option:*_
    _option name: Package Printing Specs_
    _menu_id: 1 (Engineering)_
    _relative_url: /servlet/com.sonymusic.aoma.AOMADispatcherServlet?chain=PackagePrintingSpecificationSelectProductAction_

    _is_tile: true (should be menu option and dashboard tile)_
    _description: Review and modify physical packaging print specifications_

    _default_order: 15_

    _icon_name: home_page_package_print_specs_

   {color:#172b4d}And add following permission for the option to aoma_ui_menu_options_permission_map:{color} 
_QC_METADATA_VIEW_VIDEO_PRODUCT, QC_METADATA_EDIT_VIDEO_PRODUCT, QC_METADATA_VIEW_AUDIO_ARCHIVE, QC_METADATA_EDIT_AUDIO_ARCHIVE, QC_METADATA_VIEW_DVD_PRODUCT, QC_METADATA_EDIT_DVD_PRODUCT, QC_METADATA_EDIT_PACKAGE_PRINTING_SPECIFICATION_

 

*3.* Use the existing tables aoma.ui_view_configs and aoma.user_ui_preferences for user home page preferences mapping. 

One new record in aoma.{_}ui_view_configs{_} as follows:

    _ui_view_config_id_ : 3
    {_}aoma_ui_menu_option_nm{_}: null
    {_}view_nm{_}: Home Page Default View}
    {_}view_options{_}: null

Service will insert the rest to user_ui_preferences table

Also please grant access to aoma_micro_srv_user_mgmt service db user (and devs shar051, stef003) to the following tables:

As discussed in our Teams call, The following is DB team's suggestion.

There are 3 DB items given in the Jira description
 # 1st item. New columns except default_order will be created
 # 2nd item. No issues. looks good
 # 3rd item. Use the existing tables aoma.ui_view_configs and aoma.user_ui_preferences. 

Detailed proposal for item 3:
 * One new record in aoma.ui_view_configs as follows.

{code:sql}
{{ui_view_config_id : 3}}
{{aoma_ui_menu_option_nm: null}}
{{view_nm: Home Page Default View}}
{{view_options: json array to include order and aoma ui menu option name (or) id. }}
{code}
 * aoma.user_ui_preferences will have one entry per user if the logged in user has saved their own preference as follows.

{code:sql}
{{user_id: corresponding user id}}
{{ui_view_config_id: 3 (from above new aoma.ui_view_configs entry)}}
{{ui_preferences: json array to include aoma ui menu option name (or) id and the order which user has selected}}

We have discovered recently that when Full master of Wav 24 Bit (regular or Mfit) is linked to product ( generally when a partial registration created a 24 bit master) we are also able to create a Virtual master of 24 Bit of same kind which should not be allowed. 

This is not happening in the case Wav 16 Bit master. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

If the product already has Full 24 Bit master (Regular and Mfit) then a Virtual 24 Bit master of same type/version should not be allowed to create.

This should be blocked similar to how creation of virtual 16 bit master blocks it when a Full 16 bit master is already linked to the product.

Currently AOMA has a scheduler which runs once every 30 seconds and triggers delivery api to get statuses for in progress export jobs.

Now Delivery system sends status update events to kafka _delivery-package-events_ topic in Global DS kafka cluster, so AOMA should listen to those events and update export job statuses accordingly

AOMA 3 Explicit Indicators - Display of indicators and mismatches ,AOMA3-2703,1878857,,User Story,Done,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,Done,kori002,kori002,kori002,02/Apr/25 2:39 AM,02/Sep/25 2:28 AM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,27/Aug/25 4:39 AM,,AOMA-2.113.0,,,0,"*Applicable Masters:* Stereo Audio(16, 24Bit and Vinyls), Immersive (except 360 RA) and SFV.  

Pseudo Video - Will check with GMP (need another ticket)

*Acceptance Criteria:* UST team will be ready to inherit the Explicit indicators for both productized and UST master only registrations (for SFV use case alone) and based on that we should display Explicit indicators at Assoc master section, QC notes and explicit indicators mismatches should be displayed on products tab. 

*Note:* Master only registration for SFV means UST does not have a real master only registration and we provide a checkbox up top there especially for the short form videos alone to start with where it uses the product metadata to create a master, but it does not create that link at all and hence we inherit the E indicator because we are also inheriting the ISRC from the product because there is a product underneath.

And from A2 where we register real master only there is no way we can inherit the E indicator there and hence we only consider UST registrations. 

 

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*
 * Explicit indicators should be displayed at track master level on
 ** Associated master section
 ** Master details page
 * Explicit indicator mismatches should be displayed on products tab and QC notes interface by following below mentioned cases:
 ** QC noter interface
 *** When QC notes is accessed through UST or Assoc master section we should show the Explicit mismatches based underlying product
 *** When QC notes is accessed through master details page E indicator alone is fine to display for the track master
 ** Products tab (follow the below cases)

*Case 1:* 
If the product track is clean, but the track master which is linked to is explicit then We should display the mismatches on product tab (PFA Wireframe for mismatches)

The tooltip message when we hover over the mismatch badge in this case should clearly say ""{*}Product track is clean, and the track master linked is explicit and hence the mismatch ""{*}

*Case 2:*

If the product track is Explicit and the track master which is linked to is clean, we should display the mismatches on products tab

The tooltip message when we hover over the mismatch badge in this case should say ""{*}Product track is explicit, and the track master linked is clean and hence the mismatch""{*}

 

*Case 3:* If both Product track and track master is either clean or Explicit then we display no indicator or E indicator respectively on products tab and associated master section.

Auto-pseudo enhancement - Accept animated gifs in addition to a still cover image,AOMA3-2839,1947247,,User Story,Done,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,Done,kori002,kori002,kori002,24/Jul/25 3:12 AM,27/Aug/25 4:42 AM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,27/Aug/25 4:41 AM,,AOMA-2.113.0,,,0,"*User Story:* 

As a user I want to upload a .gif image to create a Pseudo video using AOMA.

*Description:* 

Currently, AOMA pseudo video accepts only cover image as source or uploads of type .jpg or .jpeg etc. This should be extended to support .gif 

*Acceptance Criteria:*
UI should allow .gif file in addition to currently supported formats when you browse file for upload.

No validations on gif when upload as a phase 1 project. (may be in future we shall add any validations in future phase)

UI validations: No dots and spaces inside the file name and height validation - these are current validations and should be extended while accepting .gif files. Any other extra validations will be discussed later and addressed as phase 2.

If cover file is selected as source for Pseudo video or cover image is uploaded existing CT can be used for Pseudo Video creation. But if user upload .gif image, the system should be using the new CT ( MC ticket attached to get the details of new CT) to generate the Pseudo video.

CT id for accepting non gif file: 2067

CT id for accepting .gif file: 4205

*Test Cases:*
General regression testing should be conducted for Pseudo video creation using Source audio and source cover or upload of cover

Auto QC lock and Auto QC approval should also be tested for jpeg and gif uploads.

Pseudo Video created using .gif source should undergo registration using UST to create SFV and VSC master to create video product of footage type Pseudo video.

Looping of the gif should be entirely through out the audio duration in the resulting video.

VSC extracts from first frame of the gif.

We should extended that support to Stereo Audio masters as well 

*Applicable Master Types:*
|Virtual Master (Track DDP/WAV 16Bit/Video)|
|Virtual Master (Track WAV 24Bit/Video)|
|Virtual Master (Track DSD/Video)|

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*AND* permission _TEMP AOMA3 TRACK LINK MODIFY SWAP_

*AND* user has Master Execute access

*AND* Master is not empty mean asset availability flag is True

We give the ability to add (Only add not delete) of tracks for above virtual masters using Track hot swap option.

This hot swap will not check QC lock or Qc approved and the only basic sanity check are performed like the track is existing asset type, duration and ISRC mismatches are displayed basically Add track should be considered as new linking itself and when changing or replacing an existing track then it should check hot swap rules or conditions and this should be tested in terms of adding a track and replacing a track using same Track hotswap functionality

We should change the logic to check at track level from BE to see if it is adding a new track or if is replacing a track using that same track hotswap option. BE should handle this.

Then UI changes are also required to send to BE istrackhotswap flag for each track.

Both BE and UI changes will affect current logic for immersives as well and hence Immersive track hotswap should be tested.

*Note:* This should be tested only for Published products where we give the checkboxes to add more tracks to the virtual master.

We are experiencing so many A2 export failures because AMEBA will not update the deprecated tables in AOMA 2 as legacy linking does. Hence we need to point the linking and unlinking to legacy until ATF team fixes this.

*User Story:* 
As a user I would like to delete the link of Immersive (Dolby, 360 RA, Quad, 5.1,7.1) or AMB full masters (not track linked) which are linked to published products. 

*Applicable Masters:*
Immersive full masters ( Dolby, 360 RA, Quad, 5.1 and 7.1) , AMB, Closed Captions and Subtitles.  

Adding one more here for scope: All Virtual Immersive Masters 

These masters are not required for publish of a product  and not required to be locked down for 'catalog stability'. There are many use cases where we need to take down masters at storefronts due to technical issues or creative changes. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

This should be Permission driven.

*Permission Name:* LINK MODIFY PUBLISHED PRODUCTS

Permission will be only give to Select GMP users who can delete or edit the link for published products.

Given user has the above permission and ""Execute"" access

Then we should skip the check of Publish status of the product for above master types to allow delete and edit link.

*IMP NOTE:* Delete and Edit link for published products should not be available for Immersive only product. (UI will need to check Boolean property on products tracks level which needs to be defined later)

*test cases:*

*1) When user has necessary permission on full published product:*

check delete link for full master AMB , full master immersive (all types) and virtual immersive masters (all types)

and check edit link for virtual immersive master (all types){*}>>PASS for all required master types{*}

Vamsi's team is ready to support AOMA 3 full master linking for Vinyl Audio Masters with AMEBA based architecture. In this ticket we will migrate Audio Vinyl linking support to AOMA 3 UI and AMEBA.

*Applicable Masters:* 

Stereo Audio Vinyl 16bit

Stereo Audio Vinyl 24bit

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*1) Permissions:* 

It should mirror what we currently have for AOMA 3 full master linking.

Required Permissions: *AOMA 3 Link* and *Link Modify*

 

{*}2) BE Errors - All errors are blockers and should block the linking attempt{*}{*}{{*}}

*Once user enters product ID or master id and fetches the master and then select the master(s) - (multiple master linking in one action should also be supported here and hence checkboxes will be provided against masters then if any of the below error cases arises the UI should block the ""Commit Link"" button and should show the respective message(s).* 

 

When the vinyl master has no assets

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

""The Stereo Audio %%Bit Vinyl master you're trying to link has no assets.""

 

When the product configuration of the product is not one of the list provided below.

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

"" The Stereo Audio %% Bit Vinyl master cannot be linked to this Product Configuration.""

 

Product Configurations that we support linking of16 and 24 bit Vinyl masters:

 

List from GMP: 

*12 inch Vinyl Single 78*

*12 Maxi-Single Vinyl*

*10 inch Vinyl Extended Play*

*10 inch Vinyl Longplay 33 1/3*

*10 inch Vinyl Single*

*7 inch Vinyl Single*

*7 inch Vinyl Extended Play 45*

*VinylDisc Maxi Single*

*Vinyl Longplay 33 1/3*

*7 inch Vinyl EP 33 1/3*

 

 

*List from Current BE table: (One Vinyl Disc Maxi single is missing in AOMA 2 BE as compared to above list given by GMP and hence should be added to the table)*

 
|10 inch Vinyl Extended Play|
|10 inch Vinyl Longplay 33 1/3|
|10 inch Vinyl Single|
|12 inch Vinyl Single 78|
|12 Maxi-Single Vinyl|
|7 inch Vinyl EP 33 1/3|
|7 inch Vinyl Extended Play 45|
|7 inch Vinyl Single|
|Vinyl Longplay 33 1/3|

 

 

When the  Product and Master sides count is not equal

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

*""Selected master cannot be linked to this product because the product has [x] components while the master has [y]""*

 

When the product has already master of same type is linked

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

""MasterType ""Audio Master WAV [x] Bit Vinyl"" was already linked to this product by a full master. The system does not support linking more than one""

 

*3) UI Warnings: (All warnings are not blockers and should be allowed to override and commit)*

*Once user selects the Vinyl master(s) and there are no errors found then UI should display the information with all the tracks and sides with duration mismatches. Additionally, warnings should be added as secondary warning message in modal window.*

 

When total duration of the Product side is less then sum of all track durations in it.Master side 

Then display the below warning message in modal window for all the components which has mismatches

The total duration hh:mm:ss:ms of master component 'x' Side 'y'  is less then the actual duration of the label copy of component [x] Side [y] Product duration: HH:MM:SS:FF

 

*Please note* we do not have any ISRC mismatches in the Vinyl linking as we link at side level and we do not store the track sequence with track names and ISRC codes for each side at the master level and then use that to validate against product.

 

*Some additional Duration (Side) based conditions that we have to check for Vinyl masters and provide the user as a warning in the modal window:*

*For* Vinyl 16 and 24 bit masters

*User Story:* 

Vamsi's team is ready to support AOMA 3 full master linking for Vinyl Audio Masters with AMEBA based architecture. In this ticket we will migrate Audio Vinyl linking support to AOMA 3 UI and AMEBA.

*Applicable Masters:* 

Stereo Audio Vinyl 16bit

Stereo Audio Vinyl 24bit

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*1) Permissions:* 

It should mirror what we currently have for AOMA 3 full master linking.

Required Permissions: *AOMA 3 Link* and *Link Modify*

 

{*}2) BE Errors - All errors are blockers and should block the linking attempt{*}{*}{{*}}

*Once user enters product ID or master id and fetches the master and then select the master(s) - (multiple master linking in one action should also be supported here and hence checkboxes will be provided against masters then if any of the below error cases arises the UI should block the ""Commit Link"" button and should show the respective message(s).* 

 

When the vinyl master has no assets

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

""The Stereo Audio %%Bit Vinyl master you're trying to link has no assets.""

 

When the product configuration of the product is not one of the list provided below.

Then display the below  message in Red (block the commit link button)

"" The Stereo Audio %% Bit Vinyl master cannot be linked to this Product Configuration.""

*3) UI Warnings: (All warnings are not blockers and should be allowed to override and commit)*

*Once user selects the Vinyl master(s) and there are no errors found then UI should display the information with all the tracks and sides with duration mismatches. Additionally, warnings should be added as secondary warning message in modal window.*

 

When total duration of the Product side is less then sum of all track durations in it.Master side 

Then display the below warning message in modal window for all the components which has mismatches

The total duration hh:mm:ss:ms of master component 'x' Side 'y'  is less then the actual duration of the label copy of component [x] Side [y] Product duration: HH:MM:SS:FF

 

*Please note* we do not have any ISRC mismatches in the Vinyl linking as we link at side level and we do not store the track sequence with track names and ISRC codes for each side at the master level and then use that to validate against product.

 

*Some additional Duration (Side) based conditions that we have to check for Vinyl masters and provide the user as a warning in the modal window:*

The recommended duration is under 4 mins 30 seconds. The cutting facility may require prior contact to ensure the master can be manufactured as intended.>>Mixed result - there is a failure and a pass:

*PASS - if user attempts to link a master that is too long, and it's a single sided master, than the correct warning displays:*

There is a potential issue as follows:

Example product - 19658823501
Example master - 5728010

Master is 6 min 23 sec per side, and should display the duration validation for that product configuration.

But, it's inconsisent - out of 7 link attempts, the validation only displayed on the 7th attempt - and then the warning displayed, and I linking was successful.

This was tested on PC and MAC, all browsers.

The issue then is that the duration warning modal is not consistently displaying. But there is no way to force the issue to be reproduced.;;;",,,,,,,,

*06/12/2025 refinement:* This can be applicable to all ""status"" pages, not just Export Status

If a user opens A3 export status, and sets the filters using any/all attributes, filters the results, THEN clicks on a job ID, then the A3 export job details opens. IF the user then clicks on ""Return to list"" then all of the filter settings are deleted, so user has to manually repeat the process.

Expected result - filter settings should be retained if user opens a job details page and then navigates back to the list by clicking the ""Return to list"" button

Change AOMA account auth type to USM for all active AOMA users ({color:#de350b}*when we do this exercise, make sure there are no 2 active accounts that share the same UPN. If there are, highlight it to me, as we will need to backfill duplicate accounts with a new email*{color}).

*This activity should be executed as part of the STAGE cutover, and as part of the build night when the DB scripts are ran. This will be done twice at those specific times*

h1. Pre-conditions

UPN is the field which is used for login (in USM email input). We need to be careful when updating it, as it requires approval from the associated user (otherwise login will not be successful).

] {code};;;","06/May/25 10:01 PM;venu001;Checked in DEV via AOMA3-2096;;;","14/May/25 10:54 PM;jpitzer;STAGE testing in progress:



*User story:* AOMA is requested to move its authentication to USM, so all Sony Music applications use a single sign on mechanism. In order to achieve that, AOMA should adjust the AUM modal.

 
----
h1. Pre-conditions

UPN is the field which is used for login (in USM email input). We need to be careful when updating it, as it requires approval from the associated user (otherwise login will not be successful).
h4. From now on, there is going be 3 types of users in the system:
 # AZURE
 # AOMA_INTERNAL
 # USM

In USM system user can be external or internal depends on upn domain

As AOMA is looking to migrate to USM authentication for login purposes, we need to consider both internal/Sony Employee users and external users. To onboard/map external users accordingly though, we need to make sure they have UPNs associated with their accounts. Once they do, we can send this over to the relevant people for mapping in their database.

The following external active accounts seem to have a blank UPN value (these users come from AOMA3-2132); please backfill the accounts accordingly. Please also check internal users additionally, and backfill them accordingly as well:

h3. *AOMA system is requested to move its authentication to USM, so all Sony Music applications use single sign on mechanism.*

The Unified Session Manager is a Sony internal Single Sign On tool which acts as a proxy between SME applications and the Azure server. 
----
h1. Prerequisites to the story

_this section holds some dictionaries and other useful info to get more understanding of the story ACs_ 
{panel:title=Current AOMA auth types}
AZURE: Aoma user of type _AZURE_ which uses azure authentication to login

AOMA_INTERNAL: Aoma user of type _AOMA_INTERNAL_ which uses username and password, and google authenticator (as MFA) to login

OKTA: _not used_

LDAP: _not used_
h4. From now on, there is going be only 3 types of user in the system: AZURE, AOMA_INTERNAL and new type - USM.
h4. OKTA and LDAP will be removed. 

USM have a concept of external and internal users, it is decided by UPN domain (one of the SonyMusic domains - internal, any other - external)
{panel}
{panel:title=AOMA user and USM user are not the same}
Unified Session Manager is a general purpose SSO application which is used for different Sony Music applications, whereas AOMA is only for asset management.
So, user in USM and user in AOMA are different entities.
Based on this conclusion, there can be few cases:
 * internal user exists in AOMA but not in USM
 * internal user exists in USM but not in AOMA
 * internal user does not exists neither in both systems
 * external user exists in AOMA but not in USM
 * external user exists in USM but not AOMA
 * internal user does not exists neither in both systems{panel}
----
*New login page will support authentication for all available user types.*

h2. New Login page UI

!image-2025-04-04-17-10-11-417.png|width=645,height=412!

Login page consist of following interactive elements:
 * _Email_ input ({color:#ff8b00}required, email pattern validation{color})
 * _Login_ button

h3. Notes for UI devs

*After clicking on Login button:*
 * send GET request to BE service by path [https://aoma-auth-dev.smcdp-aws.net/authenticate?email=example@mail.com|https://aoma-auth-dev.smcdp-aws.net/authenticate?email=]
 * BE returns json response with 200 status (like _{color:#505f79}{""url"": ""https://uat-auth-console.sonymusic.com/oauth2/openid/v1/authorize?response_type=code&scope=openid&client_id=UDYmZmhXaDlqbj0mZiZZaG5CZDI&redirect_uri=https://aoma-auth-dev.smcdp-aws.net/validate&state=ee944d6a-de93-41f4-a0be-21c563f8e0b5&nonce=f2610cae-6a5e-433a-b593-2815e5f6dc14""}{color})_
 * Do a redirect to this url
 * No other action is required _(except handling errors from BE and potential 500* from USM)_

       BE also can return error with 400 (might 403 as well) status when business validation is failed: _{color:#505f79}like \{ ""message"": ""No external user found with    username: example@email.com"" }.{color}_ So UI should properly display these errors.

 
----
h2. Test notes
 * Regression testing is required (potential security issue might arise)
 * Concurrent sessions should be tested
 * Test with both an internal and external account
 ** Internal accounts do not have to go through secondary authentication
 ** External accounts can be set up with secondary authentication in 3 ways; they will receive a security code via:
 ### Email
 ### Phone text
 ### Authenticator (in this case, it would be the Google browser extension)
 ** To change verification method in test environments, use this URL: [https://uat-auth-console.sonymusic.com/#/login]

h2. Notes for support
 * USM admin user will be created in USM Admin Tool for managing users, lock status, etc

 *** 2000*3000
 *** 1200*1600
 *** 1000*1400
 *** 584*800
 * If the default language of the product is anything else but not ""English"" poster should display its local default language.

*Pre-Conditions:*
 * Applicable Master types
 ** Audio Master WAV 16 Bit & Audio Master WAV 24 Bit.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*Note: When user enter clicks QC notes Section via Associated Master Section or Master Details page then display AQC notes and manual QC notes by default for both users with read only access or users with edit access as well (Meaning Display Auto generated QC notes will be checked by default Current Workflow - do not change anything here).*

*Also, here user (either with read only or edit access) should have Include invalid AQC notes check box and AQC type filter options accessible if they want to see Invalid AQC notes as well and want to filter their view by AQC type.*

 

Now, we should have two buttons as following for performing changes against manual QC notes or AQC notes separately and hit Save/Cancel button to apply changes. - Only applies to user with Edit QC access. 

*Edit QC notes* (Which we already have) - Used only to edit the Manual QC notes.

*Edit AQC notes* (Which we should add beside Edit QC notes) - Used only to edit the AQC notes.

*User with Edit access only should be able see the above options. User with read only access should have these above options hidden.*

*Each AQC note should not be defaulted to yellow rather it should be defaulted to White*

*Hide the Display Auto Generated QC notes check box if user click Edit QC notes.* 

*Show and check the* *Display Auto Generated QC notes check box if user clicks Edit AQC notes* *by default* *and the Include Invalid AQC notes and filters can be displayed but unchecked and unfiltered respectively by default.*
 * *Rules for User with Read only access:*

 * Here as soon as user click on QC notes button via Associated Master section or master details page for user with only read access. 
 ** The user can use check boxes against Include Invalid AQC notes to view the desired notes (Valid + Invalid AQC notes). 
 ** User can also use AQC type filter to have filtered view on the AQC notes. 
 ** Also, user will be able to identify by the inline text against each AQC notes beside the AQC type icon indicating is it a valid AQC or an Invalid AQC note.
 ** Here we will have 3 cases for each AQC note: 
 *** Valid and Highlighted yellow 
 *** Valid and not Highlighted yellow
 *** Invalid (Not in yellow of course) and Comment icon to click and view the comments (only view comment).

 
 * *Rules for User with Edit access:*
 * Here as soon as user click on Edit AQC notes button and has permission to edit then it will be displaying 4 additional buttons called *Mark Valid, Mark Invalid, Mark Accent and Enter comments as shown* 
 * User can use checkboxes left side (given at AQC level, Track level and master level) to select one or more AQC notes and using 4 buttons top they can perform the operation they want. 
 * The system should mark valid or invalid as inline text against AQC selected as soon as user selects the Mark valid or Mark Invalid buttons up top.
 * In the case of Mark accent button, it can be used to highlight them or unhighlight them as per selected using checkboxes.

 * Enter comments can be used to enter same comment against all the selected AQC notes. By clicking enter comments button it will open a small window to enter the comment and save. (for now, we will replace the new comments entered if there are any comments existing already - we can change this as and when we feel to do so) 

 * We should also provide inline Add comment icon for the invalid ones to enter comments for individual AQC notes which will open similar kind of window to enter the comments and save on individual AQC note level.
 * Add a tooltip to comment icons to help user know about it when they mouse over the comment.

 * We can use following rules for making above 4 buttons enable. (By default, user with edit access could see only greyed out 4 buttons and as and when we select those check boxes will enable the 4 buttons based on below rules)
 ** *When* at least one checkbox is selected (may be not marked yet or already marked valid or already marked invalid) 
 ** *Then* enable both Mark Valid and Mark Invalid buttons
 ** *& if* marked valid 
 ** *Then* selected note(s) will display inline text as valid & enable Mark Accent button (Here user will ability to deselect few checkboxes after hitting mark valid button and before hitting mark accent button if user does not want to highlight those checkboxes with yellow)
 ** *or if* marked invalid 
 ** *Then* selected note(s) will display inline text as invalid & enable Enter Comments button & provide inline comments option. (Here again user will ability to deselect few checkboxes after hitting mark invalid button and before hitting Enter comments button if user does not want same comments to enter against those checkboxes and subsequently can use inline add comment icon to enter any different comment.
 * For both read only and Edit access modes implement *""Include Invalid AQC Notes""* check box and a filter based on AQC type using drop down menu using following rules: 
 ** *When* user unchecks the *""Include Invalid AQC Notes"" and no AQC filter is applied* 
 ** *Then* display `all the valid AQC notes and Manual QC notes.
 ** *When* user checks the *""Include Invalid AQC Notes"" and no AQC filter is applied* 
 ** *Then* display all the AQC notes (Valid+Invalid) and Manual QC notes. **
 ** *When* user checks the *""Include Invalid AQC Notes"" and AQC filter is applied* 
 ** *Then* display only AQC notes (Valid+Invalid) based on AQC filter type applied and no manual QC notes.
 ** *When* user unchecks the *""Include Invalid AQC Notes"" and AQC filter is applied* 
 ** *Then* display only valid AQC notes based on AQC filter type applied and no manual QC notes.
 * Reset button for resetting *""Include Invalid AQC Notes""* check box and a filter based on AQC type to default. Meaning upon hitting reset button ""{*}Include Invalid AQC Notes""{*} will uncheck and all the selections made from dropdown menu will be unselected.

*PFA wireframes for Read only access and Edit access.*

*Here is Current AQC Type list that can be used for the drop-down filter:*
Unexpected Bandwidth
Upconverted Bit Depth
Tick
Extraneous Start
Silence at Start
Silence in Track
Silence at End
Unexpected Transition
Gap
Gap HF
Single Channel Mono
Dual Channel Mono

*Test Cases:*

*Test for Audio Wav Masters (16 & 24 bit)* 
 * Test to see if the user enters clicks QC notes Section via Associated Master Section or Master Details page then it is displaying AQC notes and manual QC notes by default for both users with read only access or with edit access as well.
 * Test to see if the user (either with read only or edit access) should have Include invalid AQC notes check box and AQC type filter options accessible if the user has to see Invalid AQC notes as well and filter their view by AQC type.
 * Test to see if we have two buttons as following for performing changes against manual QC notes or AQC notes separately and hit Save/Cancel button to apply changes

*User* *Story:* As an AOMA user I would like to rate the efficacy of AQC notes generated by AI tool to collect the data and train the LLM to improve its accuracy. 

*Pre-Conditions:*
 * Applicable Master types
 ** Audio Master WAV 16 Bit & Audio Master WAV 24 Bit.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*Note: When user enter clicks QC notes Section via Associated Master Section or Master Details page then display AQC notes and manual QC notes by default for both users with read only access or users with edit access as well (Meaning Display Auto generated QC notes will be checked by default Current Workflow - do not change anything here).*

*Also, here user (either with read only or edit access) should have Include invalid AQC notes check box and AQC type filter options accessible if they want to see Invalid AQC notes as well and want to filter their view by AQC type.*

 

Now, we should have two buttons as following for performing changes against manual QC notes or AQC notes separately and hit Save/Cancel button to apply changes. - Only applies to user with Edit QC access.

I have noted down here some minor failures from testing and some suggestions from Business. Will create separate ticket for these once we discuss it with Rohit and dev team. Otherwise, everything else is looking good and hence marking it as ready for release. 

Few things to note for next implementation:

1) When user clicks Edit AQC notes the default behavior now is Include Invalid AQC notes is unchecked. So now if user comes and edit any particular AQC using inline or bulk and mark that AQC as invalid the AQC will be disappeared since the up top Include Invalid AQC notes has not been checked. This is one thing need to be solved.

2) UX suggestion when entering comments against Invalid AQC notes

3) Issue with Drop down and Include invalid AQC notes sometimes

4) Failed case where manual QC notes is being displayed per one of the AC;;;","11/Dec/24 4:41 AM;kori002;Verified in Prod:
G010001403052H
I have noted one more bug. When we do bulk operation on AQC and mark the selected AQC as valid and select accent for them. Then when we mark invalid the same set of AQC selected it is changing from Valid to Invalid, but the accent is not gone. This is working as expected when we perform individual operation using inline operations. ;;;","11/Dec/24 4:45 AM;kori002;Will create one more ticket for future build for all the bugs.;;;",,,,,,,,

1st AC should describe removing of version desc/number from all master types qc notes

2nd should move items in columns

3rd one should describe adding duplicated action buttons in the bottom of QC edit section

 

*Business Value/Description:* As an AOMA user I would like to reformat the QC notes so that I can use it more easily and make modifications to it more easily. 

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Given the user is looking at the associated masters tab of a product

When there are QC Notes available for the master

Then the QC Notes will follow the format as the mockup below shows

And the new format will remove the ""Version Number"" and ""Version Description"" from the header 

And the ""Version Number"" and ""Version Description"" should be removed from both the Edit and Read only views

And when the user is on the ""Edit QC Notes"" feature of the feature then they will be able to use an additional set of  ""Save"", ""Cancel"" and ""Clear QC Notes"" on the bottom, identical to the existing ones on the top

-And the QC Notes section underneath the Header will have its own scroll bar so that the user may see the header ""frozen"" and scroll through the QC Notes section at the same time-

And the ""QC Notes Comments"" will display in line with the field name for the criteria

And these changes will apply to the SFV, DDP, WAV16, WAV24, DSD QC Notes

 

For SFV:

!image-2024-05-03-17-29-26-573.png|width=1044,height=320!

!image-2024-05-09-08-59-25-801.png|width=1030,height=424!

!image-2024-05-03-18-09-50-466.png|width=1011,height=354!

For WAV16, WAV24, DDP, DSD:

!image-2024-05-03-17-17-03-024.png|width=1041,height=365!

!image-2024-05-09-08-49-20-996.png|width=773,height=434!

*Note:*  We will have to decide the order in which we display the sections of the QC Notes, take in to consideration the fields requested to be removed, and decide whether having an extra set of buttons at the bottom of the page or having the side scroll bar would be more convenient for the user when editing the QC Notes

It will be really helpful if users could have the ability to view the quick high-level snapshot of asset availability for a product without a deep dive. This will also help new users to understand and work efficiently on a product and its assets.

Applicable Product Configs: Only Digital Product Configurations and also not for LFV. (We will figure out, if we cannot implement this)

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

The asset availability snapshot is displayed when user clicks ""{*}Asset Availability Snapshot{*}"" button on product details page beside AOMA 3 Linking button.

The asset availability snapshot table should start with three columns:
Side, Track and Track Title

Then other columns we can start with Audio DDP's, Wav 16bit and Wav 24bit (all fidelity's including Mfit), then all Immersive masters and last SFV, VSC and Closed caption masters

If the asset is registered under a master against a particular combination of side, Track and track title then we can display green mark (should display black apple symbol if the master is Mfit)

If the asset is registered and has QC notes entered, then Orange notes icon should be displayed beside the green mark icon

If the asset is registered and has QC notes entered and approved, then Green notes icon should be displayed beside the green mark icon

If the asset is registered and has QC notes entered and locked, then red notes icon should be displayed beside the green mark icon

*Note:* This should be tested only for Published products where we give the checkboxes to add more tracks to the virtual master.

 

PS: We are limiting this to immersive only for now and similar thing will be implemented for other after discussion with business.

Edit: After discussing with business we have got confirmation to add this functionality to other master types as well. AMSE linked. 

In addition another related AMSE is created where select users (GMP only) will be given the ability to delete/edit the links for immerisve/AMB/CC/Subtitles masters for published products.

Auto-pseudo enhancement - To support and generate overlayed text of title/artist on cover ,AOMA3-2843,1947521,,User Story,To Do,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,,kori002,kori002,24/Jul/25 2:53 PM,24/Jul/25 2:56 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,,,,0,"*User Story:*
As a pseudo video user I should have ability to generate pseudo videos for an entire album using one source image, but generating text and overlaying title/artist information on the source image, making a unique image for each track of the album including the artist/title text.

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*
We Shall accept same formats of cover image as today when user tries to upload the source cover image.

When user clicks the upload and choose the file from local 

Then A small modal window should be shown where user can choose to overlay *Artist and Track title* information.

If user selects the checkbox then custom font options should also be available.

!image-2025-07-24-08-50-33-222.png|width=152,height=206!

After this when user clicks submit button AOMA should generate image with text overlay and should be uploaded

Once user clicks ""Apply to All""

Then for all the other selected tracks same overlayed text of respective track title and artist name should be populated on image to get uploaded to rest of the selected tracks.",kori002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMSE-1533,,,"24/Jul/25 2:49 PM;kori002;image-2025-07-24-08-49-45-640.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2615898/image-2025-07-24-08-49-45-640.png","24/Jul/25 2:50 PM;kori002;image-2025-07-24-08-50-33-222.png;https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/secure/attachment/2615897/image-2025-07-24-08-50-33-222.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|i3lpav:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<i>Time to resolution</i>,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,UI Backlog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the meantime, we should highlight the ""rejection"" thresholds for 4 of the new attributes. 4 of these are numerical and require user digit entry. The important thing to note here is that there is a difference between the range of acceptable values (max and min as highlighted in the powerpoint), and another range within for rejection. This smaller range's logic is what we should follow

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Following below should happen on save (review with GMP).
 * Confirm what logic should be when unchecking happens, after user edits again
 * _01/10/25:_ This is a BE ticket now; can automatically auto-accent the note when value entered falls in ""rejection"" range

 

WHEN user selects attribute Integrated Loudness
AND user inputs value > -18 LKFs
AND value is <= 0 LFKs
THEN accent checkbox on QC Note should be auto-checked

WHEN user selects attribute True Peak Loudness
AND user inputs value > -1 dBTP
AND value is <= 20 dBTP
THEN accent checkbox on QC Note should be auto-checked

WHEN user selects attribute Stereo Alignment
AND user inputs value > 50 ms
AND value <= 60000 ms
THEN accent checkbox on QC Note should be auto-checked

WHEN user selects attribute Extraneous Silence at Tail
AND user inputs value > 2000 ms
AND value <= 60000 ms
THEN accent checkbox on QC Note should be auto-checked

 

Display blue 'i' icon on each track when attribute is selected, with rejection message:
 # _Integrated Loudness:_ ""Entries > -16 LKFs can cause track to be rejected by partner""
 # _True Peak Loudness:_ ""Entries > 0 dBTP can cause track to be rejected by partner""
 # _Stereo Alignment:_ ""Entries > 500 ms can cause track to be rejected by partner""
 # _Extraneous Silence at Tail:_ ""Entries > 2000 ms can cause track to be rejected by partner""
 # {_}Unfiltered LFE{_}{*}/{*}{_}Stereo Mismatched Musical Content{_}{*}/{*}{_}Stereo Mismatched Fade{_}{*}/{*}{_}Upmixed{_}: ""Entries for these attributes can cause track to be rejected by partner""

 

*Extra use case:*
 # Edit a track QC Note which is already accented with above accepted value, put value less than ""minimum"" mentioned above, and track QC Note should become un-accented.

New Menu item *""Supply Chain Order Management (AOMA 3)""* has been created under *Asset Administration* in AOMA.

This menu item is behind the permission called *AOMA3 SUPPLY CHAIN ADMIN*

*Pre-Conditions:*

Physical Product is scheduled release for non-US territories.

GRPS first release date = null or > Current date meaning it should be a pre-release product

At least one master is registered for the product.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Apply the permission to the URL as well if in case anyone has the URL of *""Supply Chain Order Management (AOMA 3)""* and show the following message ""You do not have permission to view this page"" if user is not given the *AOMA3 SUPPLY CHAIN ADMIN* permission.

Create the New Dashboard:

a) Product # column along with product pop-over which shows the product meta data like we have in reg job status page. (Here is the URL for reg job status page in dev:  [AOMA|https://aoma-dev.smcdp-de.net/aoma-ui/registration-job-status]) 

b) Master ID along with Master Type (Applicable territory code and desc) and icon for Master Pop-over which show master meta data like in Reg Job status page.

c) Local release date (in case of EU show one country local release date with other countries release date in sub icon i.e (Display first one in the alphabetical order in column and rest all countries in the icon and also display only countries which have release date not equal to blank) and also use Dots icon to display additional information. 

d) Next columns display Title, Artist, Rep Owner, Parent Rep Owner, Maintenace Owner

e) Then we should also display Security Group column with one SG in the column (Can be sorted same as alphabetical order) and any extra SGs listed in the Sub icon. Use (+) sub icon to display additional information. This icon can be found in Export Status page ([AOMA|https://aoma-dev.smcdp-de.net/aoma-ui/export-status]) 

f) Export History column up next (any product, master and destination combination exists - return those job id or else display blank and the Job ID will go to A2 export status page if we click the job id) - JobID (Job status)

[https://aoma-dev.smcdp-de.net/legacy-embed/9QVSGWY2JIG/servlet%7Ccom%5Esonymusic%5Eaoma%5EAOMADispatcherServlet~chain*ExportSetupAction%26productID*iinput|https://aoma-dev.smcdp-de.net/legacy-embed/9QVSGWY2JIG/servlet%7Ccom%5Esonymusic%5Eaoma%5EAOMADispatcherServlet~chain*ExportSetupAction%26productID*5634647]ProductIdHere 

BE should provide productID ({*}it's not a product number{*})

g) Then we would also like to add an individual export button which in case if user want to export individual product. This button will take user to A2 Export interface in new window.

h) Otherwise, if user wants to bulk export, we provide with the option of check boxes against each product left side to select and click the Green Submit for Export button. 

(Implementing the Green ""Submit for Export"" button and checkboxes, and filters and refresh button is not scope of this ticket and will be handled later.) 

*Test Cases:* 
 * Verify if user with *""Supply Chain Order Management (AOMA 3)""* URL can access it only if user has the *AOMA3 SUPPLY CHAIN ADMIN* permission and if user does not have the permission, it shows the error message if user tries to access the URL.
 * Test to see if the columns are developed as mentioned above
 ** Product # column along with product pop-over
 ** Master # column along with master pop-over, territory code & Description.
 ** Local release date with three dots icon to see additional information
 ** Next columns display Title, Artist, Rep Owner, Parent Rep Owner, Maintenace Owner
 ** Security Group col with (+) icon for any additional info.
 * Test to see if the Export History col displays job Id which takes to A2 export status page.
 * Test to see if the last col has Export button which takes to A2 Export page.

Physical Part Orders: AOMA Created+ GRPS generated: New Dashboard ,AOMA3-2421,1759962,,User Story,Done,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,Done,kori002,kori002,kori002,26/Sep/24 7:25 AM,24/Jul/25 1:45 AM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,24/Jul/25 1:45 AM,,,,,0,"*User Story:* As an AOMA user who fulfills the Physical Supply chain orders I want an improved workflow of fulfilling orders that are originated from GRPS or created within AOMA using an efficient and fast new dashboard.

*Pre-Conditions:*

Physical Product is scheduled release for non-US territories.

GRPS first release date = null or > Current date meaning it should be a pre-release product

At least one master is registered for the product.

*Important:*
 * *Create a new menu item in Asset Administration tab called ""Supply Chain Order Management (AOMA 3)""*
 * {*}Since this project will have multiple iteration and slow rollout, we should gate it behind a permission and since this workflow is specific to only a few users, no point in displaying that menu item to everyone (to reduce clutter). here's the permission we should set up: AOMA3 SUPPLY CHAIN ADMIN{*}{*}{{*}}

 

 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

 

 

1) Export Destination filter should come with drop down menu and for now we have only export destination set up i.e Manufacturing - Central European Services (CES) 

2) Dashboard should include following columns (PFA Image for Dashboard):

a) Product # along with product pop-over like we have in reg job status.

b) Master ID along with Master Type (Applicable territory code and desc) and icon for Master Pop-over.

c) Local release date (in case of EU show one country local release date with other countries release date in sub icon i.e (Display first one in the alphabetical order in column and rest all countries in the icon and also display only countries which have release date not equal to blank) 

d) Next columns like Title, Artist, Rep Owner, Parent Rep Owner, Maintenace Owner

e) Then we also display Security Group column with one SG (Can be sorted same as alphabetical order) and any extra SGs listed in the Sub icon

f) Export History column up next (any product, master and destination combination exist - return those job id or else display blank and the Job ID will go to A2 details page if we click the job id) - JobID (Job status)

g) Then we would also like to add an individual export button which in case if user want to export individual product. This button will take user to A2 Export interface in new window.

 

*PHASE 2 (UI & BE)*

*We should finalize the display part and tweak the query and if the users say it is good, we can work on below.*

h) Otherwise, if user wants to bulk export, we provide with the option of check boxes against each product to select and click the Green Submit for Export button. 

This is the filter

*Export Destination filter: Dropdown Supported*

Manufacturing - Central European Services (CES) 

At least one or more products should be selected for submit to be enabled.

It will call UST endpoint to submit the CES export for each of the products selected by user.

If a submit is in progress, BE should block any another export jobs.

 

I)
 * *Filter based on ""Maintenance Owner"" that are associated to the user.* Meaning the Dashboard should display only that particular data of products to submit export job which user is mapped to particular group of maintenance owner when that particular user log into this dashboard page i.e when user is clicking the Supply chain Order Management (AOMA 3) via Asset Administration.
 * If any user is not mapped to at least one of the maintenance owner groups display the below message for the user upon clicking Supply chain Order Management (AOMA 3) via Asset Administration.

 

*Filter 1 - Applicable Product Configurations (for now)- Dropdown supported*

12-inch Vinyl Single 78

12 Maxi-Single Vinyl

5-inch CD Single

7-inch Vinyl Single

Blu-ray Audio Longplay

Blu-Ray Video Longplay

Cassette Longplay

CD Extended Play

CD Longplay

Vinyl Longplay 33 1/3

*Filter 2- Release Territory (Europe): New end point for getting territories* - *Dropdown supported*

Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain (UK), Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey

*Other Territories:*

Australia, Canada, Japan, China

 

 

*PFA* 

*!image-2024-09-26-01-09-01-512.png|width=401,height=96!*

*Test Cases:*
1) Test to see if the Export Destination has drop down menu with *Manufacturing - Central European Services (CES)* as destination.

2) Test to see if the Territories radion buttons are working as expected displaying only corresponding local release dates. 

3) Test to see if we have check boxes for bulk export and individual export button (right side) against each product to perform bulk and individual export respectively.

4) Test to see if the individual export button is opening the A2 export interface of that product in a new window.

5) Test to if the *AOMA3 SUPPLY CHAIN ADMIN* is working. Any user without this permission shouldn't be able to see the *Supply Chain Order Management (AOMA 3)* menu item via Asset Administration. 

6) Test to see if the Product and Master #'s have pop-over displaying metadata beside them.

7) Test to see if the all the columns mentioned in the AC are present.

8) Test to see if the Loca release date and Security Groups has icon displaying additional corresponding info.

9) Test to see if the check boxes can be selected against the products and can be exported using green Submit for Export button.

I have checked it and existing logic does work for Closed Captions SCC and TTML - *updates track title and isrc and saves master event history (no eom message is required)*

But first we need to display track title and isrc on UI for scc, ttml and subtitle (instead of or along with file name)  !image-2024-06-26-08-47-48-236.png|width=471,height=224!

 

Regarding subtitle - also works if subtitle track has record in _audio_track_masters_ table. UST is taking care of making sure this record will be present.

(I guess if track title is returned _null_ from BE, then UI should not allow editing (in the future these data will be backfilled for all subtitles)

Currently in AOMA supports only source download of LFV files from details page. It would be so much helpful if Preview/Proxy download support is also added.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
**

When User has AOMA3_EXPORT permission (Permission should be similar to what we have for SFV Preview/proxy download)

and ""Execute"" access for security groups assigned 

We should provide option of  Preview/Proxy download for Trailer files and Feature files for LFV master on Product details page.

Able to download the preview asset (mp4) of both the feature asset and the trailer asset i.e it should be open in new tab and should provide option to download from the browser. (Similar to SFV preview/proxy download)

Can you please confirm the preview_quality_order that we should set for PDFBooklet format. The other two formats PackagingGraphicPreview and PackagingGraphicThumbnail under PKGF format group have preview_quality_order set to 1.

Also, we will be setting is_active_fl and preview_format_in_use_fl flags to true for PDFBooklet format.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

The Preview feature of PKGF Printer spreads and Reader spreads (all the PDF's) should exactly mimic the DBKS preview support
 * Given the user has AOMA3 Export and Download permission

When a user clicks the thumbnail image (click the magnifying glass on center of the PKGF file similar to DBK) on the details page(assoc master section and master details page), they would like the pdf to open directly in a new tab in their web browser from which they can view or have the option to download.  (Similar to how we have on the DBKS master)

Example in stage where it has both Printer Spreads and Reader Spreads PDF:
[AOMA|https://aoma-stage.smcdp-de.net/aoma-ui/product/88697586012/associated-masters/master-details?languageId=104&masterId=5697170&masterTypeId=6]
 * Given the user has ALLOW_PREVIEW_GENERATION permission

Like other masters we should provide on demand Regenerate preview option where user can select the checkbox and the to regenerate the preview.

Checkboxes should be provided at file and component level.

Once the preview generation is initiated we should display broken image and Red border around it with a message ""Preview generation in progress"".

This ticket will handle the PKGF to DMD workflow. 
 * {color:#172b4d}Business/Angelina Capodanno confirmed she is ok with this{color}

*Pre-conditions:*

User is on product details page, whose config can link to PKGF masters

*Acceptance Criteria:*

+_UI tasks_+

Gate A3 Export button behind AOMA3 EXPORT permission and proper view/execute sec group access

New destination ""{color:#4c9aff}*Direct Mail Delivery (Physical Masters)*{color}"" should be displayed in A3 Export modal (no permission gating)

In Export interface, display 3 PKGF choices for user selection: Collect for File Output (Open Files), Printer and Reader Spreads
 * Display Territory Name and Master ID for PKGF master
 * CFO includes 2 options, so display these accordingly (will post legacy screenshot)
 ** -manifest.txt- ({_}*10/2/24:*{_} Decision after internal discussion is to exclude this in A3...so don't include this)
 ** CFO zip
 *** Since zip files can't be previewed, there will be no preview in Ci
 ** filelist.txt
 * Printer and Reader Spreads are different sections, with the file's subtype displayable
 ** Printer and Reader Spreads can display at first as collapsible like how we do for audio master types; sometimes, there can be a multitude of files. Side display is also applicable here.
 * Sort files lexi-graphically/alphabetically
 * _*01/22/2025:*_ There are use cases where a product can be linked to a DDP and a PKGF; in this case, for now, selecting above destination should show PKGF options. User should still be able to select other destinations ('Digital' Direct Mail Delivery, Sony Ci, etc) with DDP available.

 * Post-{_}*04/02/2025*{_} call:
 ** BE to try and consolidate AOMA notif and email e-cards into a single email, with a pre-signed URL for asset. This will bypass Delivery and Promo
 *** If we go with this, Delivery to add flag in schema to note that they need to generate XML; {color:#de350b}*AOMA will send this flag accordingly*{color}

DMD output is an e-card with the zipped folder, so zipping is required here. But, XML generation needs to happen on Delivery's side
 * Naming scheme (same as for Ci, from earlier implementation):
 ** *Top parent folder:* _productArtist_ + _productTitle_ + {_}productNo ({_}Ex: DJKhaled_MajorKey_889853554812)
 *** *{color:#4c9aff}In case of master-centric Export:{color}* Replace above parent folder naming scheme with below PKGF specific sub-folder naming scheme; delete below folder so that it doesn't duplicate twice.

 *** For PS and RS files, legacy AOMA uses an abbreviation; we should expand to full PKGF sub-type name
 *** When user unzips the CFO, it should adopt the new filenaming scheme above

 * Only CT being sent is 4202; no other CTs are selected for PKGFs
 * Email notification (legacy example below)
 ** Include Asset Root in Export Status section of email
 ** PKGF Exports have a separate section altogether (The Label Information is based on Package Printing Specs option, from QC Metadata menu item)

_*Extra test case:*_ Test MBC with test PKGF product No and see how/if Exports are launched (since we are using a different permission here, we should see how this is affecting it. There is also a case where a product can be linked to DDP and PKGF....existing DDP flow to Ci/DMD (digital) is allowed, but when PKGF logic is implemented, you can ONLY go to Ci (physical))

_*Extra test case:*_ Run Export to DMD on a +digital+ asset and see how its coming

AND master has at least one file available for download ({_}UI to use assetAvailability flag here{_})
THEN display ""Download All (.zip)"" -and ""Download Selected (.zip)""- button in dark gray header, next to master ID, with cloud icon
 * Nelson was thinking that the buttons should be uniform with the single cloud icon, hence why they're all the way on the right, but I'll let UI team determine what they think is better
 * !image-2025-06-09-09-51-31-964.png|width=595,height=78!

_*07/16/2025:*_ Do not display button for LFV master type
 * We can continue to display for SFV, as Jack and Himanshu were able to download no problems. Atmos and 360 RA is ok too. Confirmed on 7/18 retrospective.

 

Apply above ACs for Master Details pages, on header level blue button on Information tab (no dark gray header available, so display will be a bit different)
 * !image-2025-06-23-12-41-28-856.png|width=574,height=55!

 

WHEN user clicks ""Download All""
THEN all master's listed files should be downloaded in a single .zip folder
 * *User should not need to check any box for this*

 

-WHEN user checks any number of folder, or file, or component(s)-
-AND user clicks ""Download Selected""-
-THEN download selected files in a single .zip folder-
 * -Is it possible to have logic where clicking any of the download icons and buttons will just download selected files? That way user won't have to scroll for a 100+ track product. See below screenshot and bottom suggestion by Nelson-
 * _*06/12/2025 Refinement:*_ we decided not to go with Selected for now, and just implement ""All""
 * !image-2025-06-09-09-53-07-493.png|width=577,height=293!
 * -Button should be grayed out until a file, component or folder is selected-
 * -In order for this to work for PKGFs, we'll need to add checkboxes on each Component, folder and file in the Associated Masters section. Discuss this-

 

Keep Reason modal from single file download, but exclude the Short and Long name options from modal when ""All"" download button is selected. User should only enter Reason.
 * +*For BE:*+ The naming convention should be the filename as how the master is registered (per internal Refinement discussion with Rohit)
 ** In the future, users MAY ask for better naming. IF that happens, we can try to implement the Export naming convention(s) before the zipping happens. Since this is a full master as opposed to a track one, the current Export filenaming can be implemented with track information excluded. Current Export file-naming scheme is in Attachments as an Excel
 *** If we go with this, the naming convention is different for Master Exports, so adjust accordingly for Master Detail downloads
 * +*For UI:*+ The naming options are not applicable for PKGFs, for now...so you can exclude the options on modal when its PKGF. For QAs/Jack, when the test is run here for PKGFs, only the reason entry is expected to show.

!image-2025-03-26-14-33-41-664.png!

 

There will be a single event for a whole master download in Master Event History (in the desc, indicate this is a ""full master download"")
 * Whether it is a single file or a full master, the event history should have one entry for each
 * Event type should be HTTP Download, like previous download events
 * Like for LFV and AMB ""sub-types"", implement the same on PKGF master (has PDFs, labels, docs, zip text docs, etc, all with different master IDs)

 

Single email notification to be sent (track master information needed in the email can be called from the table that PKGF notification email uses. As this is coming from the Associated Masters section, product information should also be there)
 * For full master download email, there is also a certain table in UST which has information; this table can be used in the email to display the tracks

 

*Test cases:*
 # PKGF (One of 2 most important cases, as this will help to reduce A2 DMD traffic)
 # WAV (The other of the 2, to reduce A2 digital Export traffic. Also verify file-naming is good from Product and Master perspective)
 # Cover (A 3rd most important case, to reduce A2 digital Export traffic. Also verify file-naming is good from Product and Master perspective)

 ** In the future, users MAY ask for better naming. IF that happens, we can try to implement the Export naming convention(s) before the zipping happens. Since this is a full master as opposed to a track one, the current Export filenaming can be implemented with track information excluded. Current Export file-naming scheme is in Attachments as an Excel
 *** If we go with this, the naming convention is different for Master Exports, so adjust accordingly for Master Detail downloads
 * +*For UI:*+ The naming options are not applicable for PKGFs, for now...so you can exclude the options on modal when its PKGF. For QAs/Jack, when the test is run here for PKGFs, only the reason entry is expected to show.

 # UI will move Download button more to the left after build; do not want to make changes so close to the build (potentially we can do it in DEV?)
 # I think UI mentioned they will remove download button under thumbnail on Master Details page...this too will be done next build
 # Button state has been updated to show file size and loading icon
 # We may need to specify between ""full master download"" and ""track download"" in Master Event History, but I don't think this is a blocker for passing this ticket. We used the same event type, which should be fine
 # I think the notification file name display was already addressed, but UI needed a means to call it correctly...we can/will fix this in a separate build; Rohit is OK to proceed with this as mentioned last week
 # 360 RA can remain, even if file size is big; we will hide it for LFV though

AOMA 3 Linking - To link multiple masters in one action - Full Master linking ,AOMA3-2761,1905898,,User Story,Ready For Release,AOMA3,aoma3,software,shar051,,,Normal,,kori002,kori002,kori002,13/May/25 9:27 PM,22/Jul/25 9:49 PM,12/Oct/25 4:15 PM,,,AOMA-2.112.0,,,0,"*User Story:* Currently a user is only able to commit one full master link at a time even if from the same product number. The ability to multi-select and commit multiple full master links in one step has been requested.  This will increase efficiency and cut down on the time to link from one product to another significantly. 

*Applicable Masters:* 

We should support this functionality for all the masters that we currently support AOMA 3 full master linking. Below is the list. And as and when other masters are migrated to AOMA3 full master linking then we can extend this support to those masters. 

List of masters that we need to support:

SFV, VSC, CC (SCC and TTML), Stereo Audio (Wav 16bit and 24 bit), Audio DDP, Audio DSD, Cover, AMB, Immersive and PKGF master. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*
Applicable on AOMA3 full master linking interface when user fetch masters by inserting the Product ID.

 

WHEN the product is inserted to fetch the associated masters 

THEN list all the masters in collapsed version with checkboxes against each master to multiselect the masters to be able to link in one action *PFA* 

we have to show a warning (yellow) indicators for masters that have duration or ISRC mismatches to make user  to check deep for any mismatch warnings. 

AND in the expanded version we show all the information that we currently show when fetch the master in linking interface. *PFA*
*!image-2025-05-14-21-50-16-790.png|width=573,height=275!*

 

WHEN the product is inserted to fetch the associated masters 

AND if any master(s) is not supported to link to the product configuration type 

THEN the master(s) should be disabled and should show a red message underneath the master *""Product not found""*

AND if all the masters fetched are not supported to link to the product configuration type 

THEN all the masters should be disabled and should show a red message underneath the master {*}""Product not found""{*}and DISABLE THE COMMIT LINK BUTTON

 

 

WHEN the product is inserted to fetch the associated masters 

AND if any of the master type is already linked to the product 

THEN we disable the master type to block user to select any of those master(s) and display a message in red text as we do now. (Full master swap use case was brought up business here to give user an option to swap if necessary instead of blocking. We will address this in phase 2) *PFA*
*!image-2025-05-14-21-41-32-244.png|width=285,height=136!*

 

*If when multiple masters are linked in one action and we need to consolidate the all error(s) to show in one single message*

*After warnings modal window if no errors are popp up then the link should be successfully done for all the selected masters*

*Warnings*  *Display:* 

For bulk linking of master types we shall display warnings in one single width extended modal window. 

The modal window will be opened in collapsed version (with first one expanded) with all the masters to show the master level warnings in separate sections that are selected to commit the link along with one section for general warnings with showing indicators of warning.

 

**
Since the master types above mentioned are supported by AMEBA the bulk linking of these masters should also be supported by AMEBA

We shall create separate entries in master event history for each master that was part of the bulk linking. This should be tested.

Separate notification emails will be sent out for each master type as we do for individual linking of the master types. This also should be tested

We have revoked the access by removing all the users/Roles from this permission to hide the the menu item.

But now later figured out that this permission also gates the Preview of PQ and MS files on details page. We should remove this dependency as we are planning to kill the interface and the permission with July build. We can provide the preview access to all the users who have security level access.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

The Preview eye icon is little distorted (probably from Angular upgrade) which should be fixed.

The preview eye icon should be any permission independent and user should be able to view the previews of those files until and unless they have security group access.

GRPS has Audio Encoding and Video Encoding fields mapped to ISRC in which it identifies what master type of  ISRC the track is. 

This information is not currently in AOMA and hence it would be super helpful if we have this flowed into ISRC table that we have. 
We can use this information to simplify our logic of identifying the track master type from ISRC especially for Immersive avoiding the complex logic that we have now to identify from related ISRC and related products.

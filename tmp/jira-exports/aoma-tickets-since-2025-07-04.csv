* The PG-MIG database environment will be solely for use by the AWS/L&T AWS/L&T Postgres Migration team and we will NOT need a Tx Mgr development cluster linked to it. Instead, we should plan on doing the small amount of development work we need to do (DB connections, modifications of error handling, dictionary load changes) directly in environment linked to PG-TEST.

Will update the diagram whenever a new one is published.

Please add the following enhancements:

1)	Export: Add exported by user name and email address to email notifications (add the below image for example)
2)	AOMA3: User managed email subscriptions
3)	Unifying email notifications

First one can be done early next year.

Hey Rohit/Ralph, 

Could we get the sender added to these notifications? 

Also, I’m wondering if we should have an audit of all e-mail notifications and message configurations scheduled for some time in our future.  It seems like there are multiple export notification types and they appear to differ in ways that could probably be made more uniform? 
What do you think? 

Maybe try to clean up the logic around notifications.  I think it would even be cool for future to allow users to manage their own notifications through a user preference or profile in AOMA3. 

Thanks,

 Sharada;;;","30/Jun/20 6:25 PM;rich014;[~bsahoo1], [~SAMA030] : Brajesh/Ralph, Please provide an estimate for when you believe this will be completed.  It is required for a release we need to implement soon.  Thank you, Reid;;;","06/Jul/20 2:57 PM;sdonipu;[~bsahoo1] - To fix compilation errors (reported in AOMA2-226) you will need to add JAXB binding file. For the bit-depth issue, the DSD file doesn't have a bit-depth when I view it in the MediaInfo tool, so you are not able to see it. To validate whether bit-depth was read from the DSD file previously, Can you please attach a sample descriptor file generated by current/old *CTID 1066* which uses the FFMpeg tool? 

The issue reported for DSD assets by SCOPs (ACS-1096) was for the discrepant data found for the SAMPLE_RATE metadata on the DSD file versus the value of sample_rate delivered in the partner XML files by Delivery. So in order to fix the discrepancy, the AOMA-Core system needs to use new CT 2600  and parse the Descriptor files generated by the MediaInfo tool which is driven by the new *CTID 2600* and backfill all of the registered DSD assets with the accurate SAMPLE_RATE value. That way, when Delivery reads the metadata of a DSD file from the AOMA asset management tool, they read the correct sample_rate and put it in their partner XML files.

Let me know if any further doubts/questions.

Thanks,
Sharada

So looks like there was no bit-depth info available for DSD files even previously in the past. You will have to check on your end how currently AOMA system and wherefrom it gets bit-depth for DSD files and persists to AOMA DB. The media Conversion system is not providing a bit-depth for DSD Descriptors because neither FFMpeg nor MediaInfo tools were able to extract it from the DSD file as DSD file

 

Please note, BIT_DEPTH and SAMPLE_RATE both metadata are different and serve a different purpose. Please check with [~roraj01] which all values need to be backfilled along with SAMPLE_RATE using the new CTID 2600 and make decisions accordingly. 

 

{color:#172b4d}In both of the below XML outputs, there is no BIT_DEPTH with a valid value. Can you please check where is AOMA reading/persisting bit_depth as 1 for the current and registered ~3000 DSD assets in production?{color}

 Sharada;;;","13/Jul/20 2:41 PM;sdonipu;Just a thought/idea/recommendation/suggestion to share :

We can also leverage this *CT2600* as a solution for generating DESCRIPTOR XMLs of other audio and video asset types as well like *AUDIO* (WAV16, WAV24, DDP, Bluray DDP, DVD DDP, Vinyl WAV16, Vinyl WAV24, etc) and *VIDEO* (ProRes, MPEG-2, LFV, etc) if we want to standardized the tool and method of extracting metadata with the same tool and move off from FFMpeg for Asset Creation (Descriptor Generation) Phase. 

That's said, the MediaInfo tool is much more verbose and efficient than FFMpeg in terms of extracting the metadata of any AUDIO and VIDEO file. Please give it a thought, discuss it with [~mish003], and let us know what you guys decide. 

I will break out this topic as well, as a separate ACS ticket so that we can address it separately in the future.

During the e2e testing in STAGE: https://jira.smedigitalapps.com/jira/browse/ACS-1271 and review of the Mora DSD sample_rate fix by GMP [~jdunca1] found out that the product ""G010001279180Z"" in AOMA STAGE is not showing the correct sample rate in UI. Looks like a data issue on the AOMA side.

The sample_rate value in UI should match with that on the source DSD file.

The temporary backfill for DSD was done using AOMA2-286 with a default value of a single-DSD to expedite the process for SMEJ as a majority of products are single-DSD (confirmed by business in weekly meetings). The backfill with real descriptors is a more involved process that will be handled by AOMA2-287 (pending internal discussion).

 

Any new registrations should have correct data as confirmed in our E2E testing.

 

Please let me know if there are any questions/concerns on this.

We need to utilize this client system to determine attempt_initiator_type in AMEBA Graphql. 
So, we need to modify the AOMA code to pass the client system for both AOMAUI and registration requests, as they both use the same username. This will enable AMEBA to identify which system or process is calling it and update attempt_initiator_type accordingly.

Yes , attempts from GRPS , CSA etc .. should be recorded as AOMAAPI as per existing types .. maybe we should also rename AOMAAPI to AMEBA API . ;;;","18/Jul/25 4:32 PM;gvamsik;[~zeki001] - Just saw your comment .

I think it's fine for logging to use what we have already. 

But, this is more to consider setting the correct parameter when AMEBA publishes a Kafka message, for consistent evidence in the DB and Kafka stream. 

It seems that all messages are using the default value ""RDX_CHD"". 

!image-2025-07-18-18-27-38-588.png!

Does it make sense for you to set it when AMEBA publishes a message to Kafka? 

If we need to re-route a message or do something similar in the future, then we don't need to make a query to the DB to check the initiator system, we can do it with the information from the message header. This can correspond to the DB values.

When the same attempt comes through CDC for TxMgr to process, TxMgr should not update the attempt initiator type if it already exists for the attempt. I believe this should address the issue, correct?;;;","06/Aug/25 3:58 PM;zeki001;[~gvamsik] - Correct.

This is part of Phase 2 of the GRAS Export decommissioning project.  

Currently, when a user submit a priority import via the UI, it will create a record in the import attempt table and send a jms message to the priority queue for Transaction Manager to pick up.

Since we are switching to Kafka, we need to send a kafka message instead to the priority topic.

We should have a flag to be able to send a message via jms or kafka or both, for testing or in case of rollback.

It makes sense to report Kafka topic lags and message queue depths as separate entities.

In addition, since the [Delivery Dashboard|https://ddb-dev-ext.smecde.com/delivery-dashboard-ui/] have instruments to mark a service as in maintenance, there is no need in our own UI and HTTP endpoints for controlling the downtime. Those can be removed to simplify the code.

In the AVRO schema, we've added UPC, IsCompleteFl, and ConfigKey ( NULL is valid value ) . This information will be beneficial for Mobile Auto linking and DDEX - Asset flow. Including these fields in the message will help avoid unnecessary callbacks.
 

Schema also has failure object , I think we would to good to publish failed events as well and DDEX can record failures for DDEX UPCs .

We do not have import of task types in the parallel environments. So task type syncing needed to be done manually. I just added the new ones manually in stage and prod. Please verify. And note, this may happen again in case of new task types and it will need manual syncing. Please reach out to us if you encounter this issue again.

AMEBA PROD Gateway - TxMgr vault service route and user,AOMA-16968,1937459,,Task,Closed,AOMA,AOMA,software,roraj01,AOMA Project,http://wiki.smedigitalapps.com/display/AOMA,Normal,Resolved,zeki001,zeki001,zeki001,07/Jul/25 3:48 PM,09/Jul/25 9:54 AM,12/Oct/25 4:13 PM,09/Jul/25 9:54 AM,,,,Transaction Manager,,,0,,,"Hello [~aomadatadevs], 

We need to add a new route to the AMEBA Prod Gateway:
 * [https://ameba-prod-gw.smcdp-aws.net/txmgr-vault-service/] 

It needs to point to: 
 * ""txmgr-vault-service"" service, running on ""ameba-prod"" EKS cluster, ""txmgr-prod"" namespace, port 8099 (This is already configured in dev and stage)

Localhost example URL: 
{code:java}
http://localhost:8099/vaultSecret/v1?secretName=aomap-aoma-txmgr-user  {code}
Also, we need a new user who has access to this route. The username in dev/stage is: txmgr_app.

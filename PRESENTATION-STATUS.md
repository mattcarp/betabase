## 🎯 What is The Betabase?

**The Betabase transforms complex system documentation into intelligent, conversational knowledge.**

Instead of searching through PDFs, wikis, and scattered documentation, users can simply ask questions and get accurate, context-aware answers about any system.

**Current Showcase**: AOMA (Asset and Offering Management Application) at Sony Music

## 💡 The Problem

### Traditional Documentation Challenges:
- ❌ Information scattered across multiple sources (PDFs, Confluence, emails, wikis)
- ❌ Users don't know where to find answers
- ❌ Static documentation becomes outdated quickly
- ❌ New team members struggle to onboard
- ❌ Support teams repeatedly answer the same questions

### What Users Want:
- ✅ "Just tell me how to do X in AOMA"
- ✅ "What's the difference between these two features?"
- ✅ "Walk me through this workflow step-by-step"

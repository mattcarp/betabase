    "Deliver real-time, accurate transcription and AI-powered meeting summaries and insights.",
    "Provide detailed speaker identification, sentiment, and emotion analyses to enrich meeting context.",
    "Visualize audio input dynamically with a cinematic heads-up display (HUD) featuring glassmorphism and interactive elements.",
    "Ensure system health monitoring, user settings management, and smooth integration with external AI services and content aggregators.",
    "Implement a scalable, modular AI/ML architecture that supports real-time analysis and batch processing with privacy and compliance considerations."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Magic Link Authentication using AWS Cognito with domain restriction to @sonymusic.com and specific whitelisted users.",
    "React-based Login Form handling magic link and password options with domain validation and error handling.",
    "Circular HUD Layout inspired by sci-fi interfaces featuring glassmorphism effects and radial progress indicators.",
    "Conversational AI integration via ElevenLabs API for real-time transcription and AI conversation capabilities.",
    "Audio Waveform Visualization showing live audio signal intensity.",
    "Live Transcription component with AI-generated insights dashboard displaying summaries, decisions, and trends.",
    "Comprehensive AI/ML backend modules supporting speaker diarization, sentiment and emotion detection, quality scoring, topic clustering, and predictive analytics.",
    "System Health Monitor and Settings Panel for user configuration and system status reporting.",
    "AOMA Content Aggregator and MCP Client Wrapper for external content and service integration.",
    "Audio-responsive digital rain terminal visualization reflecting microphone and system audio input levels as an ambient indicator."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the app and authenticates via a magic link sent to an approved email address under @sonymusic.com or a whitelisted user.",
    "Upon successful login, user is greeted with a futuristic HUD interface providing live meeting data visualization, transcription, and AI insights.",
    "Audio input is captured in real-time from user microphone and meeting streams, processed to show dynamic visualizations including audio waveforms and digital rain effects.",
    "Transcriptions are streamed live, processed through the AI/ML pipeline modules that enrich the meeting data with speaker analysis, sentiment, topics, and recommendations.",
    "Users interact with settings panels to customize their experience, view system health status, and explore AI insight dashboards for enhanced meeting productivity.",
    "At meeting end, data is exported or stored with vector representations for further analysis and retrieval."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Authentication requires magic link login and enforces domain restrictions correctly, with error handling for invalid emails.",
    "Real-time transcription latency is under 2 seconds, with accuracy above 85% for key classification tasks.",
    "AI-generated meeting summaries and insights achieve user satisfaction ratings above 4 out of 5.",
    "Audio visualizations correctly reflect audio SPL levels from microphone and meeting inputs, verified visually and via logged data.",
    "AI/ML modules perform efficiently under load with memory usage under 2GB for full pipeline and no UI blocking.",
    "System health monitor accurately reports status with error rates below 5%.",
    "Accessibility guidelines are met with proper color contrast, reduced motion options, and keyboard navigation.",
    "Privacy policies are enforced by data minimization, encryption, anonymization, and configurable retention.",
    "Component responsiveness and HUD layout adapt correctly across screen sizes and device types."

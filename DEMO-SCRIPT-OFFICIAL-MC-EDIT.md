# Betabase Demo Script - Official (MC Edit)



## Preamble

* all on localhost except for gemini call

* all open source: Apache or MIT, or I wrote it.
  Multi-tenan (ERD)

* all libraries are MIT or Apache open source
* Three pillars (quick)

## Main Content

1. Knowledge base with tool calls:
   Start with hard, but answerable question

2. also what's in the upcoming release and how to prepare for it (maybe see. Jiras)

   2. Diagramming - mermaid to nano banana pro - pick good question/answer candidate ("visual intelligence")
   3. Tool calling: ask to read a DDP (should parse all files, including the CD text) - ignore files over 20 megs and check for DDPMS.
   4. Curation segue - thumbs down on an answer
      1. ask no-hallucination question "Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?"

3. Knowledge Curation with RLHF, HITL

   1. • Management of the knowledge base

      ​	• "Upload proprietary documents"

      ​	• "Delete outdated files"

   2. Show curation cue, how thumbs down in chat produces note in the cue

   3. Mention Human Knowledge vs Knowledge that no LLM could *ever* know (Keith) - anecdotal, "water cooler", phone calls, etc. Also, guardrails that only hums could put on AI.

   4. **If possible,** Tester Mode with moveable ladybug, Switching of testing context depending on which app ladybug moves to (ask claude code to make a feature - will have to use Windsurf or Antigravity)

4. Testing with natural speech to code, code to human-runnable (Prerequisites, teps, expected outcome)

   1. Scroll through long list of human-created tests and results, expand one (pick) (Jack)

   2. Auto-ranking of tests ready for Automation

      1. show one generation

   3. Self Healing with Blast Radius, demo (stand up AOMA-UI?)

      1. Move rename button, self healing fixes the test. Move to the top right: ask for human intervention.

      

## Wrap

* HITL

* New Title: Knowledge Curator of AI (doesn't cost anything to give a fancy title)



### Notes for integration:

**Three-tier system**: Tier 1 (>90% auto-approved), Tier 2 (60-90% human review), Tier 3 (<60% architect)

==========================

## AI Slop - See if You Can Splice It In:

## Strategy Section: Small Language Models (45 seconds)

**Transition**: "Now let me explain our strategic approach..."

**Your talking points:**

• " Gemini knows: protein folding, quantum physics, medieval history"

• "Do Sony Music users need that?"

• "This creates an opportunity for Small Language Models"

• "Our solution: Fine-tuned SLM, domain-specific training"

• "The benefits are substantial -cost "
  - **Faster response times** - queries that take 20 seconds could take 2 seconds
  - **Lower cost** - fine-tuned small models are 10-20x cheaper to run
  - **More accurate** - domain-specific knowledge, no irrelevant information

• You can see a roadmap, where:
  - Current: Gemini 3 with RAG
  - Next: Fine-tuned possible locally hosted, open source model

• "Similar intelligence, faster responses, lower cost"



## Former Closing Recap (15 seconds)

**Your final lines:**

• "Let's recap the seven differentiators:"

• "✅ Multi-source knowledge with too calls and re-ranking"

• "✅ Visual diagram generation"

• "✅ Development context intelligence"

• "✅ Anti-hallucination trust"

• "✅ Strategic SLM approach"

• "✅ Semantic deduplication"

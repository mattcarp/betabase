## 💬 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Segment A: Hook (30s)
- **NOT** another chatbot
- Enterprise intelligence for Sony Music
- **7 differentiators**
- Strategic SLM approach

### Demo 1: Multi-Source (45s)
Query 1: "What is AOMA?"
- Standard RAG, proprietary docs
- ~50 pages internal documentation

Query 2: "Show me JIRA tickets..."
- **JIRA + Git + Docs simultaneously**
- Custom AOMA Mesh MCP server
- **Differentiator #1: Unified knowledge**

### Demo 2: Visual Intelligence (45s)
Query 3: "Generate architecture diagram..."
- Most chatbots: text walls
- SIAM: actual Mermaid diagrams
- **Differentiator #2: Visual diagrams**

### Demo 3: Dev Context (45s)
Query 4: "Development status of AOMA3..."
- JIRA + Git + Email = comprehensive context
- Cross-source synthesis
- **Differentiator #3: Development intelligence**

### Demo 4: Anti-Hallucination (30s)
Query 5: "Does AOMA have blockchain?"
- **Trick question** - doesn't exist
- Honest "no information available"
- **Differentiator #4: Trust**

## 🎤 Segment B: SLM Strategy (45s)

**Problem:**
- GPT-4/5 knows: protein folding, quantum physics
- Sony Music users: DON'T need that

**Solution:**
- Small Language Model + Fine-tuning
- Domain-specific: AOMA, DDEX, Sony workflows
- **FASTER, CHEAPER, MORE ACCURATE**

**Roadmap:**
- Current: GPT-4o/5 with RAG
- Next: Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini
- Future: Custom SLM

**Differentiator #5: Strategic AI approach**

## 📁 Segment C: Curate Tab (1:00)

### Actions:
1. Click "Curate" tab in sidebar
2. Show document management
3. **HOVER** over Dedupe button (GitMerge icon)

### Talking Points:
- Upload: proprietary docs
- Delete: outdated files
- **Dedupe: 85% semantic similarity**
- Keeps newest, removes duplicates
- **59 automated Playwright tests**

### Final Recap (15s):
- ✅ Multi-source knowledge
- ✅ Visual intelligence
- ✅ Development context
- ✅ Anti-hallucination
- ✅ Strategic SLM roadmap
- **Questions?**

## 🚨 EMERGENCY LINES

**If Demo Slow:**
- "While this processes, let me explain..."
- "Processing multi-source query..."
- [Use silence - trim in editing]

**If Something Breaks:**
- "Let me try that again..."
- "This is why we have 59 automated tests..."
- "The key point is..."

## ✨ CHARMING TRANSITIONS

### After Baseline Demo:
- "That's standard RAG... nothing special yet..."
- "**Now watch this...**"

### After Multi-Source Demo:
- "Most chatbots stop at one data source..."
- "**We're pulling from JIRA, Git, Docs, AND Email simultaneously...**"

### After Visual Demo:
- "Text is fine, but **engineers love diagrams**..."
- "This actually **generates them on the fly**..."

### Before Strategy Section:
- "Here's the **really interesting part**..."
- "We're not just using off-the-shelf models..."

### On SLM Concept:
- "GPT-4 is impressive, but **do Sony Music users need quantum physics**?"
- "We're building **domain-specific intelligence**..."

Agent: Coding
Duration: ~10m

## Summary
✅ Refined "Intelligence Ready" empty state in HistoricalTestExplorer
- Removed distracting "floating" hover effect from the right panel by removing `mac-card` global class and using manual stable layout.
- Fixed layout clipping issue where the top icon was cut off by changing `justify-center` to `justify-start` and adding top padding (`pt-24`).
- Eliminated distracting animations including `group-hover:rotate-6` and `scale-110` on sub-modules for a calmer, more professional feel.
- Files modified: `src/components/test-dashboard/HistoricalTestExplorer.tsx`

## Next Steps
- 🎬 Final demo recording for the Test pillar.
- Verify entire Test pillar E2E before final submission.

## Warnings/Blockers
- None. UI is now more stable and less "fidgety" during interactions.

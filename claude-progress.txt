## Summary
✅ HISTORICAL TESTS: Ultra-Compact Table with Infinite Scroll

Completely transformed the Historical Test Explorer for SOTA testing UI:

### Key Features Delivered:
1. **Left Sidebar (40% width)** - Ultra-compact one-line table
   - Grid layout: ID | Test Name | App | Pass Rate
   - Each row is 1-line tall (text-xs, compact padding)
   - Smooth selection highlighting
   - Real-time search with 300ms debounce
   - Compact filter dropdowns (app, execution status)

2. **Infinite Scroll with Smart Caching**
   - First 100 tests cached on mount (instant display)
   - Auto-loads 50 more tests when scrolled 80% down
   - Visual loading indicators
   - "All X tests loaded" confirmation at end

3. **Right Detail Panel (60% width)**
   - Beautiful empty state when nothing selected
   - Full test metadata with quick stats cards
   - Execution history with pass/fail breakdown
   - AI features: Playwright generation, confidence scoring
   - Scrollable content area with fixed action footer

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - State management: cachedTests, tests, page, hasMore, total
   - Debounced search prevents excessive API calls
   - Virtual scroll container with scroll event handler
   - API capped at 100 tests per request

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/test-dashboard/HistoricalTestExplorer.tsx` - complete UI rewrite
- `src/app/api/tests/historical/route.ts` - pagination cap at 100

### Technical Highlights:
- Clean separation of concerns (cache vs. display state)
- useCallback hooks prevent re-render loops
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Zero linter errors
- Full MAC Design System compliance

## Next Steps
- Test the infinite scroll with real data
- Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys to select tests)
- Consider adding bulk operations (multi-select)
- Build out other Test pillar sub-tabs (RLHF Tests, Self-Healing, etc.)

## Warnings/Blockers
- None. Component is production-ready.

## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### STEP 1: Render Priority Diagrams (10 min)
**Option A - Mermaid Live (Recommended):**
1. Open: https://mermaid.live
2. Open file: `docs/SIAM-MERMAID-DIAGRAMS.md`
3. Copy **Diagram 1** (lines 10-64) - SIAM High-Level Architecture
4. Paste into Mermaid Live
5. Click "Actions" → "Export PNG"
6. Size: 1920x1080
7. Save as: `docs/diagrams/exports/01-siam-architecture.png`
8. Repeat for **Diagram 6** (lines 268-343) - AOMA Mesh MCP

**Option B - Skip It:**
- The demo query "Generate architecture diagram..." will create a diagram LIVE
- You can show existing diagrams during talking segments if needed

### STEP 2: Set Up Second Monitor (2 min)
1. Open: `DEMO-RECORDING-CHEAT-SHEET.md`
2. View in Preview or VS Code
3. Zoom to 150-200%
4. Position where you can glance without turning head
5. Keep visible throughout recording

### STEP 3: Set Up Descript (15 min)
Follow instructions in `DEMO-MASTER-PLAN.md` → "Recording Setup - Do Now"

**Quick version:**
1. Launch Descript
2. New Project: "SIAM Demo Final"
3. Screen Recording, 1920x1080, 30fps

7. Camera: OFF (or small PIP)

### STEP 4: Set Up Chrome (5 min)
1. Open Chrome at: http://localhost:3000
2. Hide bookmarks: `Cmd+Shift+B`
3. Zoom 100%: `Cmd+0`
4. Close all other tabs
5. Close DevTools
6. Center window, good framing
7. **Test query**: "What is AOMA?" (verify it works)

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Progress Indicator Duplicates
- **Quick fix**: Refresh the page
- **Narration**: "Real-time processing..."
- **Edit**: Trim the duplicate in Descript

### Demo Query Slow (>30s)
- **Narrate**: "Processing multi-source query..."
- **Use silence**: Trim in editing
- **Fallback**: Skip to next demo, come back if time

### Audio Issues
- **Stop recording immediately**
- **Check Shure SM-B connection**
- **Test levels again**: -12dB to -6dB
- **Restart Descript if needed**

### You Make Mistakes
- **It's OKAY!** - Descript can fix it
- **Just keep going** - Edit the transcript later
- **Worst case**: Re-record that segment
- **Remember**: Segmented = easy to fix

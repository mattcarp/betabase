## 🎯 The Demo Story

### **Act 1: Chat** (90 seconds)

**Show**: User asks "How do I create an offering in AOMA?"  
**Point**: Multi-tenant vector search with source citations  
**Tech**: Sony Music → PDE → AOMA isolation

### **Act 2: Curate** (90 seconds)

**Show**: User provides feedback to improve the answer  
**Point**: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)  
**Tech**: Feedback loop that trains the system over time

### **Act 3: Fix** (120 seconds)

**Show**: Complex query triggers HITL breakpoint, human verifies  
**Point**: Human-in-the-Loop at runtime (not just post-hoc feedback)  
**Tech**: LangGraph 1.0 breakpoints for active oversight

### **Bookends**:

- **Intro** (45s): Talking head - set context
- **Outro** (45s): Talking head - recap, closing

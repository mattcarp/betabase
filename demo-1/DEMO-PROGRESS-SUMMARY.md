## 🎯 Demo Strategy: Technical, Not Marketing

### **Core Message**:
"This isn't a chatbot. It's a **knowledge management system** with human oversight."

### **Three-Act Structure**:

#### **Act 1: Chat** (90 seconds)
- **Problem**: Users need answers from proprietary AOMA docs
- **Solution**: Vector search with source citations
- **Demo**: "How do I create an offering in AOMA?"
- **Key Point**: Multi-tenant isolation (Sony Music → PDE → AOMA)

#### **Act 2: Curate** (90 seconds)
- **Problem**: Answers incomplete or outdated
- **Solution**: Human feedback loop (RLHF)
- **Demo**: Add feedback to improve future answers
- **Key Point**: System learns from users over time

#### **Act 3: Fix** (120 seconds)
- **Problem**: Complex/risky queries need human oversight
- **Solution**: LangGraph HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)
- **Demo**: Breakpoint triggered, human verifies, agent resumes
- **Key Point**: Not just feedback after—active oversight during execution

### **Audience**: 
Technical colleagues, engineers, knowledge management professionals

### **Tone**: 
Conversational, confident, colleague-to-colleague (NOT sales pitch!)

- [ ] Save to `/demo-1/slides/exports/`

### **Phase 2: Record Talking Head Segments** (30 minutes)
- [ ] Setup: Camera, lighting, microphone (Shure SM-B)
- [ ] Record 3 segments:
  1. Intro (45s) - Set context, explain workflow
  2. Transition (30s) - Explain HITL concept
  3. Outro (45s) - Recap, closing
- [ ] Multiple takes okay! Pick best in editing
- [ ] Save to `/demo-1/assets/video/`

### **Phase 3: Record Screen Segments** (45 minutes)

  - "SONY MUSIC / PDE / AOMA"
  - "🚨 HIGH RISK QUERY"

- [ ] Watch exported video (catch any issues)
- [ ] If needed: Re-export with fixes

## ⏰ Estimated Production Time

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Create Manus slides | 30 min | 0:30 |
| Record talking heads | 30 min | 1:00 |
| Record screen demos | 45 min | 1:45 |
| Import to Premiere | 15 min | 2:00 |
| Rough cut | 1 hour | 3:00 |
| Fine-tune edit | 1.5 hours | 4:30 |
| Color grade | 45 min | 5:15 |
| Audio mix | 1 hour | 6:15 |
| Add graphics | 45 min | 7:00 |
| Review & revise | 1.5 hours | 8:30 |
| Export | 30 min | 9:00 |
| **TOTAL** | **~9 hours** | **Full day of work** |

**Can be faster** (~6 hours) if you:
- Skip color grading (keep natural)
- Skip background music
- Fewer text overlays
- Accept first takes (less revision time)

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

### **What Makes This Demo Effective**:

1. ✅ **Technical Credibility**
   - Real AOMA scenario
   - Actual system architecture (multi-tenant)
   - Shows underlying tech (LangGraph, pgvector, RLHF)
   - NOT just feature showcase

2. ✅ **Clear Story Arc**
   - Problem → Solution → Impact
   - Chat (get answers) → Curate (improve system) → Fix (human oversight)
   - Each section builds on previous

3. ✅ **Visual Polish**
   - Professional slides
   - Clean screen recordings
   - Smooth transitions
   - Text overlays for emphasis

4. ✅ **Colleague-Appropriate**
   - Not sales-y or hype-y
   - Technical but accessible
   - Shows real work, real decisions
   - Invites questions and discussion

---

## 📊 What's Left to Build (Optional)

These are **not required** for the demo video, but could enhance it:

### **Code Samples** (2-3 hours)
- Vector search query example
- Multi-tenant isolation code
- LangGraph HITL breakpoint example
- Could use in slides or as B-roll

### **Sample Data** (1 hour)
- AOMA knowledge fixtures (JSON)
- Demo queries that always work
- Test data for reproducibility

### **Standalone Demo App** (8+ hours)
- Minimal UI showing Chat/Curate/Fix
- Could record from this instead of production app
- More control, fewer surprises during recording

**Recommendation**: Skip these for now. You can build them later if needed.

## 🚀 Ready to Record?

### **You Have Everything You Need**:

✅ **Complete recording script** with timing and narration  
✅ **Manus slide specifications** ready to build  
✅ **Adobe Premiere production guide** for editing  
✅ **Visual assets** (animated ERD, diagrams)  
✅ **Demo queries** copy/paste ready  
✅ **Production checklists** for setup  

### **Your Next Action**:

**Option A - Start Small** (Recommended):
1. Create Manus slides (30 min)
2. Record just the intro talking head (5-10 min)
3. Import to Premiere and test workflow
4. If it looks good → continue with full production

**Option B - Full Production**:
1. Block out 6-9 hours
2. Follow Phase 1-11 workflow above
3. Create entire demo start-to-finish

**Option C - Get Feedback First**:
1. Share scripts/slides with colleague
2. Get feedback on approach
3. Revise if needed
4. Then proceed to production

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### **Before Recording**:
- Practice talking head script (don't memorize—just get comfortable)
- Test demo queries (make sure they work!)
- Ensure good lighting, quiet space
- Have water nearby

### **During Recording**:
- Multiple takes are FINE (pick best in editing)
- If you flub a line, pause, then start the sentence over
- Don't worry about perfection—Premiere can fix almost anything
- Energy is more important than precision

### **During Editing**:
- Save project frequently (Cmd+S)
- Create version backups before major changes
- Watch full timeline before exporting
- Test on different devices (phone, laptop, TV)

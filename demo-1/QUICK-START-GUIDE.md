## 🎯 Your Next Decisions

### **Option A: Full Production (Recommended)**
**Timeline**: 9 hours spread over 3-4 days

1. **Today (2 hours)**: Create all 7 Manus slides, export them
2. **Tomorrow (2 hours)**: Record talking head segments (intro, transition, outro)
3. **Day 3 (2 hours)**: Record screen demo segments (Chat, Curate, Fix tabs)
4. **Day 4-5 (3 hours)**: Edit in Adobe Premiere (rough cut → fine-tune → audio → graphics)
5. **Day 6**: Review, revise, export final video
6. **Day 7**: Share with colleagues! 🎉

### **Option B: Just Slides First**
**Timeline**: Tonight (1 hour)

1. Create all 7 Manus slides
2. Export them
3. Review how they look
4. Decide tomorrow if you want to proceed with full video

### **Option C: Minimal Demo**
**Timeline**: 4 hours total

Skip:
- Talking head footage (voiceover only)
- Color grading
- Background music
- Fewer text overlays

Keep:
- Manus slides
- Screen recordings
- Basic editing

Still looks professional, much faster.

## ⚠️ Common First-Time Issues

### **"Manus slides look different when exported"**
- Preview before exporting
- Export one slide, test in Premiere
- Adjust, then export rest

### **"I don't like how I sound on camera"**
- Normal! Everyone feels this way
- Do multiple takes, pick best
- Remember: Colleagues are here to learn, not judge

### **"Demo queries don't work in my app"**
- Test them before recording
- Have backup queries ready
- Worst case: Edit in post to show "what it would look like"

### **"Premiere is overwhelming"**
- Start simple: just assemble clips
- Don't worry about polish on first pass
- Follow the Production Guide step-by-step

## 🎬 RECORDING STRATEGY - SEGMENTED APPROACH

### Why Segmented?
- Easier to get each part perfect
- Can re-record just one segment if needed
- Less pressure than one 4:45 take
- Faster editing (splice in Descript)

### Segment A: Hook + Demos (3:00)
**Recording steps**:
1. Hit Record in Descript
2. Deep breath, smile
3. Start Hook (30s talking):
   - "Not another chatbot..."
   - "Enterprise intelligence for Sony Music..."
   - "7 differentiators, strategic SLM approach..."
4. Demo 1 (45s):
   - Query: "What is AOMA?"
   - Narrate: "Standard RAG, proprietary docs..."
   - Query: "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits"
   - Narrate: "Multi-source: JIRA, Git, Docs, Email - Differentiator #1"
5. Demo 2 (45s):
   - Query: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA showing all integration points"
   - Narrate: "Visual diagrams, not text walls - Differentiator #2"
6. Demo 3 (45s):
   - Query: "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
   - Narrate: "Dev context synthesis - Differentiator #3"
7. Demo 4 (30s):
   - Query: "Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?"
   - Narrate: "Trick question, honest 'no info' - Differentiator #4"
8. Hit Stop
9. Review: Audio clear? Queries worked? Timing good?

**If needed**: Re-record this segment (it's the most important)

### Segment B: SLM Strategy (45s)
**Recording steps**:
1. Hit Record
2. Pure talking (no screen action):
   - "GPT-4/5 knows protein folding, quantum physics"
   - "Sony Music users don't need that"
   - "Small Language Model + fine-tuning"
   - "Domain-specific: AOMA, DDEX, Sony workflows"
   - "FASTER, CHEAPER, MORE ACCURATE"
   - "Current: GPT-4o/5 → Next: Fine-tuned mini → Future: Custom SLM"
   - "Differentiator #5: Strategic AI approach"
3. Hit Stop
4. Review

**Easiest segment** - just you talking with confidence

### Segment C: Curate Tab + Close (1:00)
**Recording steps**:
1. Hit Record
2. Click "Curate" tab in sidebar
3. Narrate while showing:
   - "Document management - Upload proprietary docs"
   - "Delete outdated files"
   - [HOVER over Dedupe button with GitMerge icon]
   - "Intelligent deduplication - semantic similarity at 85% threshold"
   - "Keeps newest, removes duplicates automatically"
   - "All backed by 59 automated Playwright tests"
4. Final recap (15s):
   - "Multi-source knowledge, visual intelligence, dev context"
   - "Anti-hallucination, strategic SLM roadmap"
   - "Questions?"
5. Hit Stop
6. Review

## ✂️ EDITING IN DESCRIPT (30 minutes)

### Phase 1: Quick Splice (5 min)
1. Arrange segments: A → B → C
2. Trim dead space at start/end of each
3. Add smooth transitions (1-2 second overlap)

### Phase 2: Cleanup (15 min)
1. Let Descript transcribe all segments
2. Click "Remove filler words" button (auto-removes um, uh, like)
3. Edit transcript to remove:
   - False starts
   - Long pauses
   - Any stumbles
4. Transcript edits = video edits (Descript magic!)

### Phase 3: Polish (10 min)
1. Add captions (auto-generate, review for accuracy)
2. Style: Bottom-center, readable font
3. Watch full video start-to-finish
4. Fix any jarring cuts
5. Check timing: Should be 4:30-4:45

### Phase 4: Export (2 min)
1. Click "Publish"
2. Export as: MP4
3. Resolution: 1080p
4. Quality: High
5. Download

**Total editing time: ~30 minutes**

## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Hook (30s)
- Not another chatbot
- Enterprise intelligence for Sony Music
- 7 differentiators
- Strategic SLM/fine-tuning approach

### Differentiators (Repeat Throughout)
1. **Unified enterprise knowledge** (not isolated silos)
2. **Visual diagram generation** (not text walls)
3. **Development intelligence** (not just doc lookup)
4. **Anti-hallucination trust** (no fabrication)
5. **Strategic SLM approach** (not plug-and-play)

### SLM Strategy (45s)
- GPT-4/5: Protein folding, quantum physics (overkill)
- Sony Music: AOMA, DDEX, workflows (specific)
- Benefits: **Faster, cheaper, more accurate**
- Roadmap: GPT-4o/5 → Fine-tuned mini → Custom SLM

### Curate Tab (45s)
- Upload: ~50 pages AOMA docs
- Delete: Outdated files
- Dedupe: **Semantic similarity at 85% threshold**
- Testing: 59 automated Playwright tests

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Audio Choppy
- Close other apps
- Restart Descript
- Lower quality to Medium

### If Screen Laggy
- Close DevTools
- Close other Chrome tabs
- Record screen-only (no camera)

### If You Keep Making Mistakes
- Take a break, walk around
- Record in smaller chunks
- Remember: Descript can fix almost anything

### If Demo Query Slow
- Narrate while waiting: "Processing multi-source query..."
- Use silence - it's okay
- Can trim long pauses in editing

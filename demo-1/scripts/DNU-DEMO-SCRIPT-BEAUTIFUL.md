• "What makes it different? Seven key differentiators"

• "Let me show you..."

---

## 💬 Demo 1: Baseline Query (45 seconds)

**Query**: `What is AOMA?`

**Your narration:**

• "First, let's establish a baseline"

• "I'll ask: What is AOMA?"

• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**

• "Standard RAG response from proprietary Sony Music documentation"

• "About 50 pages of internal docs"

• "Notice the streaming response and source citations"

## 🔗 Demo 2: Multi-Source Intelligence (45 seconds)

**Query**: `Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits`

**Your narration:**

• "Now here's where it gets interesting"

• **[Start typing slowly]**

• "Show me JIRA tickets... related to AOMA migration... and the related code commits"

• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**

• "Watch what's happening here"

• "It's querying JIRA, Git repositories, and documentation"

• "All simultaneously"

• "Most chatbots: one data source"

• "Ours: unified enterprise intelligence"

• "**Differentiator #1: Multi-source knowledge synthesis**"

---

## 📊 Demo 3: Visual Intelligence (45 seconds)

**Query**: `Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA showing all integration points`

**Your narration:**

• "Next, visual intelligence"

• "Most chatbots: walls of text"

• "Watch this..."

• **[Start typing]**

• "Generate a system architecture diagram..."

• **[PAUSE - wait for diagram to render]**

• "It's not just describing the architecture"

• "It's GENERATING a visual diagram"

• "Mermaid diagrams, system flows, architecture visualizations"

• "Engineers love diagrams, not text walls"

• "**Differentiator #2: Visual diagram generation**"

---

## 🔧 Demo 4: Development Context (45 seconds)

**Query**: `What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?`

**Your narration:**

• "Here's where it gets really interesting"

• "Development context analysis"

• **[Start typing]**

• "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"

• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**

• "Look at what it's doing"

• "It's analyzing JIRA, Git commits, documentation, email discussions"

• "Cross-source synthesis for comprehensive project status"

• "Not 'what does documentation say'"

• "But 'what's ACTUALLY happening across our development pipeline'"

• "**Differentiator #3: Development intelligence**"

---

## 🛡️ Demo 5: Anti-Hallucination Test (30 seconds)

**Query**: `Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?`

**Your narration:**

• "Now let's test trustworthiness with a trick question"

• **[Start typing]**

• "Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?"

• "This feature does NOT exist"

• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**

• "Notice: honest 'no information available' response"

• "It doesn't fabricate features"

• "Critical for enterprise trust"

• "You need to know when it doesn't know"

• "**Differentiator #4: Anti-hallucination trust**"

---

## 🎯 Strategy Section: Small Language Models (45 seconds)

**Transition**: "Now let me explain our strategic approach..."

**Your talking points:**

• "Here's the really interesting part"

• "GPT-4 knows: protein folding, quantum physics, medieval history"

• "Do Sony Music users need that? No."

• "This creates a massive opportunity for Small Language Models"

• "Our solution: Fine-tuned SLM, domain-specific training"

• "Trained on: AOMA, DDEX, Sony Music workflows"

• "The benefits are substantial:"
  - **Faster response times** - queries that take 20 seconds could take 2 seconds
  - **Lower cost** - fine-tuned small models are 10-20x cheaper to run
  - **More accurate** - domain-specific knowledge, no irrelevant information

• "Our roadmap:"
  - Current: GPT-4o with RAG (what you're seeing now)
  - Next: Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini (faster, cheaper)
  - Future: Custom SLM (fully optimized)

• "Same intelligence, faster responses, lower cost"

• "**Differentiator #5: Strategic SLM approach with fine-tuning**"

---

## 📁 Demo 6: Curate Tab (45 seconds)

**Action**: Click "Curate" tab

**Your narration:**

• "Let me show you the knowledge management side"

• **[Click Curate tab]**

• "This is where we manage the knowledge base"

• "Upload proprietary documents"

• "Delete outdated files"

• **[HOVER over Dedupe button - GitMerge icon]**

• "This dedupe feature: 85% semantic similarity threshold"

• "Automatically removes duplicate documents"

• "Keeps newest, removes redundant"

• "**Differentiator #6: Semantic deduplication**"

---

## 🎬 Closing Recap (15 seconds)

**Your final lines:**

• "Let's recap the seven differentiators:"

• "✅ Unified multi-source knowledge"

• "✅ Visual diagram generation"

• "✅ Development context intelligence"

• "✅ Anti-hallucination trust"

• "✅ Strategic SLM approach"

• "✅ Semantic deduplication"

• "✅ And all of this backed by 59 automated Playwright tests"

• "**Differentiator #7: Comprehensive testing**"

• "Questions?"

## 🚨 Emergency Backup Lines

**If demo is slow:**
• "While this processes multi-source query..."
• "Real-time enterprise intelligence takes a moment..."
• [Use silence - trim in editing]

**If something breaks:**
• "Let me try that again..."
• "This is why we have 59 automated tests..."
• "The key point is..."

**If you make a mistake:**
• "Actually, let me rephrase that..."
• "What's important here is..."
• "Let me show you..."

## ✨ Charming Transitions

**After baseline demo:**
• "That's standard RAG... nothing special yet..."
• "**Now watch this...**"

**After multi-source demo:**
• "Most chatbots stop at one data source..."
• "**We're pulling from JIRA, Git, Docs, AND Email simultaneously...**"

**After visual demo:**
• "Text is fine, but **engineers love diagrams**..."
• "This actually **generates them on the fly**..."

**Before strategy section:**
• "Here's the **really interesting part**..."
• "We're not just using off-the-shelf models..."

**On SLM concept:**
• "GPT-4 is impressive, but **do Sony Music users need quantum physics**?"
• "We're building **domain-specific intelligence**..."

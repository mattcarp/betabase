RAG Performance Optimization (Parallel & Conditional Execution)

Implements multi-stage latency optimizations for the Unified RAG pipeline:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Fires Initial Vector Search in parallel with Query Transformation LLM call.
2. **Conditional Transformation**: Skips LLM transformation for simple queries (< 8 words, no ambiguous pronouns), saving ~800ms.
3. **Speculative Reranking**: If transformation doesn't change the query, skips secondary vector search.
4. **Skip Reranking**: For very high confidence (>0.88) vector matches in the initial search, skips the re-ranking step entirely.

Verified with `scripts/test-rag-quality.ts` to ensure data flow and logic correctness.

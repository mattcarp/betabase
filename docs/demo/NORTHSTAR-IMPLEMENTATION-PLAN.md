# Northstar Demo Implementation Plan

## 🌟 Objective
Create a "State of the Art" (SOTA) demo showcasing the three pillars of The Beta Base: **Chat**, **Curate**, and **Testing**. The final output will be a polished video edited in DaVinci Resolve.

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars

### 1. Show-stopping Chat Experience 💬
*   **Goal**: Demonstrate "Groovy" visual intelligence and multi-source recall.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Mermaid diagrams with zoom/pan/export.
    *   Thought bubbles for reasoning.
    *   Inline citations.
    *   Voice UI visualization.
*   **Status**: ✅ Verified (Screenshot: `chat_interface`).

### 2. State-of-the-art Curate Tab 🧠
*   **Goal**: Showcase HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) knowledge curation.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Feedback queue (thumbs/stars/text).
    *   Document relevance toggles.
    *   Accuracy metrics.
*   **Status**: ✅ Verified (Screenshot: `curate_tab_clicked`).

### 3. Automated Testing with HITL 🧪
*   **Goal**: Prove reliability through "thousands of seeded tests" and automated generation.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Unified Results Dashboard.
    *   Manual Testing Panel.
    *   Session Playback.
*   **Status**: ✅ Verified (Screenshot: `testing_tab_clicked`).

## 🎬 Video Production Plan (DaVinci Resolve)

### Phase 1: Recording (OBS / Screenflick)
*   **Setup**: Clean browser window (localhost:3000), hidden bookmarks, 1080p resolution.
*   **Segments**:
    1.  **Intro & Chat**: "What is AOMA?" -> Diagram generation -> "Show me JIRA tickets".
    2.  **Curate**: Navigate to Curate tab -> Show feedback queue -> Correct an answer.
    3.  **Testing**: Navigate to Test tab -> Show dashboard -> Run a test -> Show failure & fix.

### Phase 2: Editing (DaVinci Resolve)
*   **Import**: Bring recordings into DaVinci Resolve.
*   **Pacing**: Trim dead air, speed up loading times (if any).
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Add "The Beta Base" intro bumper.
    *   Use zoom-ins for key details (e.g., diagram nodes, citations).
    *   Overlay text for key takeaways ("Multi-source Recall", "HITL Curation").
*   **Audio**:
    *   Voiceover (recorded separately or in DaVinci Resolve).
    *   Background music (subtle, tech/modern).

## 📅 Execution Steps

1.  **Final Polish**: Ensure all mock data looks realistic (no "Lorem Ipsum").
2.  **Rehearsal**: Run through the script once without recording.
3.  **Record**: Capture the three segments.
4.  **Edit**: Assemble in DaVinci Resolve.
5.  **Review**: Verify against success criteria.

## ✅ Success Criteria
*   Video length: ~4 minutes.
*   All 3 pillars clearly demonstrated.
*   High production value (smooth cuts, clear audio, professional overlays).
*   "Wow" factor achieved through visual intelligence and seamless workflow.

# RLHF Demo - Visual Assets Guide

## 🎨 Generated Images

I've created beautiful visuals for your HITL demo presentation. All images are saved in `docs/demo/assets/`.

## 1. Dashboard Metrics Overview

![RLHF Dashboard Metrics](/Users/matt/Documents/projects/siam/docs/demo/assets/rlhf-dashboard-metrics.png)

**File:** `rlhf-dashboard-metrics.png`

**Use Case:** Opening slide or dashboard overview
- Shows accuracy trend improving from 85% → 96%
- Feedback distribution (145 helpful, 32 corrections, 18 edits)
- Key metrics cards (Pending, Submitted, Avg Rating)
- Mac-inspired glassmorphism design

**When to Show:**
- During dashboard overview (1:15 in demo script)
- When explaining measurable HITL impact
- As a summary slide at the end

## 2. HITL Workflow Diagram

![HITL Workflow](/Users/matt/Documents/projects/siam/docs/demo/assets/hitl-workflow-diagram.png)

**File:** `hitl-workflow-diagram.png`

**Use Case:** Explaining the continuous improvement cycle
- Shows 5-step circular workflow
- AI Response → Curator Review → Feedback → Learning → Better Responses
- Professional infographic style with icons

**When to Show:**
- During introduction (explaining "learning system")
- When answering "How does HITL work?"
- As a conceptual overview before diving into examples

---

## 3. Before/After Comparison

![Before After HITL](/Users/matt/Documents/projects/siam/docs/demo/assets/before-after-hitl.png)

**File:** `before-after-hitl.png`

**Use Case:** Demonstrating HITL impact visually
- Split screen: Before (72% accuracy, scattered docs) vs After (96% accuracy, organized docs)
- Shows transformation from generic AI to curated intelligence
- Powerful visual for "why HITL matters"

**When to Show:**
- During impact visualization (6:00 in demo script)
- When explaining the value proposition
- As a closing slide emphasizing transformation

## 📊 How to Use in Presentation

### Option 1: PowerPoint/Keynote Slides
1. Create a slide deck with these images
2. Use between live demo sections
3. Sequence:
   - Slide 1: HITL Workflow (intro)
   - Live Demo: Curate tab walkthrough
   - Slide 2: Dashboard Metrics (overview)
   - Live Demo: Specific examples
   - Slide 3: Before/After (impact)

### Option 2: Embed in Demo Video
If recording with DaVinci Resolve/Descript:
1. Import images as B-roll
2. Overlay during voiceover sections
3. Use transitions (fade, slide) between images and screen recording

### Option 3: Second Monitor Display
- Keep images open on second monitor
- Switch to them during relevant talking points
- Return to live demo for interactions

## 💡 Talking Points for Each Visual

### Dashboard Metrics
> "Here's what systematic human curation looks like in practice. Notice the upward trend—that's not accidental. It's the result of 183 curator actions, each one making the system smarter."

### HITL Workflow
> "This isn't a one-time training process. It's a continuous cycle where every interaction can be reviewed, refined, and fed back into the system. This is how we achieve enterprise-grade accuracy."

### Before/After
> "This is the transformation we're talking about. On the left, a generic AI making educated guesses. On the right, a curated intelligence system backed by domain experts. That 24-point accuracy jump? That's human expertise at work."

## 🎨 Design Notes

All images feature:
- **Dark theme** with purple/blue/green accents (matches The Beta Base branding)
- **Glassmorphism effects** (Mac-inspired aesthetic)
- **Professional typography** (clean, readable)
- **High contrast** (works well in presentations)
- **Enterprise-grade** design language

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review images** - Open each file and verify they match your vision
2. **Create slide deck** (optional) - Import into PowerPoint/Keynote
3. **Practice transitions** - Between images and live demo
4. **Print reference card** - Keep `RLHF-DEMO-QUICK-REF.md` visible

**Note:** I hit the image generation quota limit after 3 images. If you need the multi-tenant architecture diagram or hero banner, I can generate them later, or you can use these 3 for now and supplement with the live demo.

**Pro Tip:** The Before/After image is particularly powerful for senior managers. Lead with the problem (before), show the solution (live demo), then reinforce with the result (after).

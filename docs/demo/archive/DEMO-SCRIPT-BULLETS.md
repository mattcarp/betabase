# SIAM DEMO SCRIPT - Read This While Recording

## OPENING (30 seconds)

• "Hi everyone, this is a demo of SIAM - our enterprise intelligence platform"
• "This demo is running on our AI testing infrastructure"
• "59 automated tests, Playwright, Vitest, full CI/CD pipeline"
• "But testing is a separate video"
• "Today I want to show you what makes this different from every other chatbot"
• "It's unified enterprise intelligence that connects documentation, JIRA tickets, code repositories, and email context"
• "Let's dive in"

---

## DEMO 1: Baseline - What is AOMA? (1 minute)

**[Type query: "What is AOMA?"]**

• "First, let's establish a baseline"
• "I'll ask a simple question: What is AOMA?"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "Standard RAG response from our proprietary Sony Music documentation"
• "Notice the streaming response and source citations"
• "About 50 pages of proprietary internal docs"
• "Nothing special yet, just establishing what the system knows"

---

## DEMO 2: Multi-Source Intelligence (2 minutes)

**[Type query: "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits"]**

• "Now here's where it gets interesting"
• "I'm going to ask it to query MULTIPLE sources simultaneously"
• **[Start typing slowly]**
• "Show me JIRA tickets... related to AOMA migration... and the related code commits"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "Watch what's happening here"
• "It's querying our custom AOMA mesh MCP server"
• "That server is pulling from JIRA, our Git repositories, and documentation"
• "All at the same time"
• "Most chatbots: one data source"
• "Ours: unified enterprise intelligence"
• "JIRA tickets, code commits, and documentation context - cross-referenced automatically"
• "This is point of differentiation number one"

---

## DEMO 3: System Diagrams (2 minutes)

**[Type query: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA showing all integration points"]**

• "Next, let's talk about visual intelligence"
• "Most chatbots give you walls of text"
• "Watch this"
• **[Start typing]**
• "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
• **[PAUSE - wait for diagram to render]**
• "It's not just describing the architecture"
• "It's actually GENERATING a visual diagram"
• "Mermaid diagrams, system flows, architecture visualizations"
• "This transforms abstract system knowledge into actionable visuals"
• "Technical audiences love diagrams"
• "Point of differentiation number two: visual diagram generation"

---

## DEMO 4: Development Context Analysis (2 minutes)

**[Type query: "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"]**

• "Here's where it gets really interesting"
• "Development context analysis"
• **[Start typing]**
• "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "Look at what it's doing"
• "It's analyzing development activity across multiple sources"
• "What's in JIRA? What changed in Git? What do the docs say? Any email discussions?"
• "Cross-source synthesis to give you a comprehensive project status"
• "Not just 'what does the documentation say'"
• "But 'what's ACTUALLY happening across our development pipeline'"
• "This is genuinely novel"
• "Point of differentiation three: development context intelligence"

---

## DEMO 5: Code-Level Intelligence (2 minutes)

**[Type query: "Find the authentication implementation in our codebase"]**

• "Now let's bridge documentation to actual code"
• **[Start typing]**
• "Find the authentication implementation in our codebase"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "It's searching our local Git repositories"
• "Finding file locations, code snippets, commit history"
• "Links documentation concepts to actual implementation"
• "Most enterprise chatbots: documentation only"
• "Ours: code-level intelligence"
• "Point of differentiation four"

---

## DEMO 6: Anti-Hallucination Test (1.5 minutes)

**[Type query: "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"]**

• "Now let's test trustworthiness with a trick question"
• **[Start typing]**
• "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"
• "This feature does NOT exist"
• "Let's see if it admits that"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "Notice: honest 'no information available' response"
• "It doesn't fabricate features"
• "It doesn't make up capabilities"
• "This is critical for enterprise trust"
• "You need to know when it doesn't know"

---

## DEMO 7: Proprietary Knowledge (1.5 minutes)

**[Type query: "How does AOMA integrate with Sony's downstream reporting systems?"]**

• "Finally, proprietary enterprise knowledge"
• **[Start typing]**
• "How does AOMA integrate with Sony's downstream reporting systems?"
• **[PAUSE - let it respond]**
• "This is proprietary Sony Music Enterprise knowledge"
• "Internal system architecture"
• "Integration specifications, workflows, design decisions"
• "Knowledge that does NOT exist on the public internet"
• "This is your company's specific systems"
• "Your competitive advantage"
• "Point of differentiation five: proprietary enterprise knowledge"

---

## OPTIONAL: Voice Demo (1 minute)

**[Click microphone, speak a question]**

• "One more thing I should mention"
• "Full voice conversational interface"
• **[Click mic, say: "What are the main components of AOMA?"]**
• "You can actually TALK to your enterprise knowledge base"
• "Voice input, voice output through ElevenLabs"
• "Hands-free operation"
• "Ask questions while looking at code or diagrams"
• "Most enterprise chatbots: text only"
• "Ours: full voice conversation"
• "Point of differentiation six"

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

• "So let's recap the key differentiators"
• "One: Multi-source unified knowledge"
• "Docs, JIRA, Git, and Email in a single conversational interface"
• "Two: Visual diagram generation, not just text"
• "Three: Development context analysis"
• "Understanding what's happening across multiple sources"
• "Four: Code-level intelligence with Git repository analysis"
• "Five: Proprietary Sony Music Enterprise knowledge"
• "Six: Full voice conversational interface"
• "And seven: Trust through anti-hallucination"
• "All of this backed by comprehensive AI testing infrastructure"
• "59 tests, Playwright, Vitest, full CI/CD"
• "But that testing infrastructure... that's the next video"
• "Thanks for watching"

---

## EMERGENCY BACKUP LINES

If something breaks:
• "Let me try that again..."
• "The response is still streaming, bear with me..."
• "This is why we have 59 automated tests..."
• "In production, this runs much faster..."

If you get stuck:
• "What's important here is..."
• "The key point is..."
• "Let me move on to show you..."

**TOTAL TIME: 12-15 minutes**
**TONE: Conversational but confident**
**PACE: Medium - pause for responses, don't rush**

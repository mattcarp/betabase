# DEMO CHEAT SHEET - REAL Differentiators

## The Core Message (30 seconds)

"This isn't just another chatbot with RAG. It's an enterprise intelligence platform that unifies documentation, JIRA tickets, code repositories, and email context into a single conversational interface."

---

## 6 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES)

### 1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Multi-Source Unified Knowledge (KILLER FEATURE)

**What:** Custom AOMA Mesh MCP aggregates docs + JIRA + Git + Email
**Not:** Single data source like every other chatbot
**Demo:** "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits"
**Say:** "Querying multiple sources simultaneously... JIRA + Git + Docs... most chatbots: one source, ours: unified enterprise intelligence"

### 2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ System Diagram Generation

**What:** Visual diagrams (Mermaid, architecture flows)
**Not:** Text walls
**Demo:** "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
**Say:** "Most chatbots give you text... this generates actual visual diagrams"

### 3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Development Context Analysis (GENUINELY NOVEL)

**What:** Cross-source intelligence - what's happening across JIRA + Git + Docs + Email
**Not:** Just document retrieval
**Demo:** "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
**Say:** "Analyzing development activity across multiple sources... comprehensive project status from multiple signals"

### 4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Code-Level Intelligence

**What:** Git repo analysis - searches code, commits, links to docs
**Not:** Documentation only
**Demo:** "Find the authentication implementation in our codebase"
**Say:** "Searching local git repositories... links documentation to actual implementation"

### 5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proprietary Enterprise Knowledge

**What:** Sony Music internal systems (AOMA), not public data
**Not:** Generic internet knowledge
**Demo:** "How does AOMA integrate with Sony's downstream reporting systems?"
**Say:** "This is proprietary Sony Music knowledge... internal system architecture, not public information"

### 6. ⭐⭐⭐ Anti-Hallucination + Citations (TABLE STAKES)

**What:** Honest "I don't know" responses
**Not:** Making up features
**Demo:** "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"
**Say:** "Notice: honest 'no information available'... critical for enterprise trust"

## DEMO SEQUENCE (12-15 minutes)

**0:00 - Opening Tease (30s)**

- "This demo runs on our AI testing infrastructure (59 tests)"
- "But that's a different video... today: unique capabilities"

**0:30 - Quick Baseline (1 min)**

- Query: "What is AOMA?"
- Say: "Standard RAG response from proprietary Sony Music docs... establishing baseline"

**1:30 - DIFF #1: Multi-Source Intelligence (2 min)**

- Query: "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits"
- Say: "Multiple sources simultaneously... JIRA + Git + Docs unified"
- Highlight response showing tickets, commits, and doc references

**3:30 - DIFF #2: Diagram Generation (2 min)**

- Query: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA showing all integration points"
- Say: "Most chatbots = text... ours = visual diagrams"
- Wait for diagram to render, highlight it

**5:30 - DIFF #3: Development Context (2 min)**

- Query: "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
- Say: "Cross-source analysis... JIRA + Git + Docs + Email... comprehensive status"

**7:30 - DIFF #4: Code Intelligence (2 min)**

- Query: "Find the authentication implementation in our codebase"
- Say: "Searching git repos... linking docs to code... file locations and commits"

**9:30 - Anti-Hallucination (1.5 min)**

- Query: "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"
- Say: "Honest response... doesn't fabricate features"

**11:00 - DIFF #5: Proprietary Knowledge (1.5 min)**

- Query: "How does AOMA integrate with Sony's downstream reporting systems?"
- Say: "Proprietary Sony Music knowledge... not public information"

**12:30 - Closing (1 min)**

- "6 key differentiators: multi-source intelligence, diagrams, development context, code analysis, proprietary knowledge, trust"
- "All backed by AI testing infrastructure... next video"

## KEY PHRASES TO USE

**Multi-Source Intelligence:**

- "Unified enterprise intelligence"
- "Docs + JIRA + Git + Email"
- "Cross-references automatically"
- "Not isolated silos"

**Diagrams:**

- "Visual intelligence"
- "Actionable visualizations"
- "Not just text walls"

**Development Context:**

- "Cross-source analysis"
- "Comprehensive project status"
- "Multiple signals, one answer"
- "Development activity intelligence"

**Code Intelligence:**

- "Git repo analysis"
- "Links docs to code"
- "Actual implementation"
- "File locations and commits"

**Proprietary Knowledge:**

- "Sony Music Enterprise systems"
- "Internal architecture"
- "Not public information"
- "Your company's specific systems"

## WHAT TO AVOID SAYING

❌ "Live system data" (we don't have that)
❌ "Real-time AOMA state" (we have docs, not live APIs)
❌ "Production monitoring" (not what we do)
❌ "System health checks" (not implemented)

✅ "Unified knowledge from multiple sources"
✅ "Proprietary documentation and context"
✅ "Development intelligence across JIRA, Git, and docs"
✅ "Code-level analysis"

---

## WHAT THE AOMA MESH MCP ACTUALLY DOES

**Documentation:**

- Crawled from Confluence, internal wikis
- 50+ pages of proprietary Sony Music docs
- AOMA system architecture, workflows

**JIRA Integration:**

- search_jira_tickets
- get_jira_ticket_count
- Development status tracking

**Git Integration:**

- search_git_commits
- search_code_files
- Local repository analysis

**Email Integration:**

- search_outlook_emails
- Project context from email threads

**Cross-Source:**

- analyze_development_context
- Unified vector store with source metadata

## OPENING & CLOSING

**Opening (verbatim):**
"This demo is running on our AI testing infrastructure - 59 automated tests, Playwright, Vitest, full CI/CD pipeline. But testing is a different video. Today I want to show you what makes this different from every other chatbot: unified enterprise intelligence that connects documentation, JIRA tickets, code repositories, and email context."

**Closing (verbatim):**
"So the six key differentiators: one, multi-source unified knowledge - docs, JIRA, Git, and Email in a single interface. Two, visual diagram generation. Three, development context analysis - understanding what's happening across multiple sources. Four, code-level intelligence with git repository analysis. Five, proprietary Sony Music Enterprise knowledge. And six, trust through anti-hallucination. All of this backed by comprehensive AI testing infrastructure, which... is the next video."

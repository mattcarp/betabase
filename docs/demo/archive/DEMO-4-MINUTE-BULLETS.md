# SIAM 4-MINUTE DEMO - BULLET SCRIPT
**For incredibly charming presenters who talk around bullets**

---

## SEGMENT 1: HOOK (30 seconds)

### Opening
- Not another chatbot
- Enterprise intelligence platform for Sony Music
- 7 key differentiators
- Proprietary knowledge + SLM/fine-tuning strategy

---

## SEGMENT 2: CORE DEMOS (2.5 minutes)

### DEMO 1: Baseline + Multi-Source (45 sec)
**Query 1**: "What is AOMA?"
- Basic RAG from proprietary Sony Music docs
- ~50 pages internal AOMA documentation
- **Then switch**
**Query 2**: "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration and the related code commits"
- Multiple sources simultaneously: JIRA + Git + Docs
- Custom AOMA Mesh MCP server
- Cross-referenced automatically
- **Differentiator #1**: Unified knowledge, not isolated silos

### DEMO 2: Visual Intelligence (45 sec)
**Query**: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA showing all integration points"
- Most chatbots: text walls
- SIAM: actual Mermaid diagrams
- System flows, architecture visualizations
- **Differentiator #2**: Visual diagram generation

### DEMO 3: Development Context (45 sec)
**Query**: "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
- Not just "what does doc say?"
- JIRA status + Git commits + Email threads = comprehensive context
- Cross-source synthesis
- **Differentiator #3**: Development intelligence

### DEMO 4: Anti-Hallucination (30 sec)
**Query**: "Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?"
- Trick question - doesn't exist
- Honest "no information available"
- No fabrication, no confidence when uncertain
- **Differentiator #4**: Enterprise trust

---

## SEGMENT 3: THE STRATEGY (45 seconds)

### SLM + Fine-Tuning Concept
- **Problem**: GPT-4/5 knows protein folding, quantum physics
- **Reality**: Sony Music users don't need that
- **Solution**: Small Language Model + Fine-tuning
  - Domain-specific: AOMA, DDEX, Sony workflows
  - Proprietary knowledge only
  - Faster, cheaper, more accurate for our use case
  - No hallucination about irrelevant topics

### Why This Matters
- Lower latency (smaller model)
- Lower cost (fewer parameters)
- Higher accuracy (focused training)
- Better trust (only knows what we teach it)

### Future Path
- Current: GPT-4o/5 with RAG (works today)
- Next: Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini on Sony Music corpus
- Future: Fully custom SLM for enterprise deployment
- **Differentiator #5**: Strategic AI approach, not just plug-and-play

---

## SEGMENT 4: CLOSE (15 seconds)

### Recap
- Multi-source unified knowledge
- Visual intelligence
- Development context analysis
- Anti-hallucination trust
- Strategic SLM/fine-tuning roadmap

### Next
- 59 automated tests backing this
- AI testing infrastructure (separate topic)
- Questions?

## CHARMING TRANSITIONS (Use Between Bullets)

### After Baseline Demo
- "That's standard RAG... nothing special yet..."
- "Now watch this..."

### After Multi-Source Demo
- "Most chatbots stop at one data source..."
- "We're pulling from JIRA, Git, Docs, AND Email simultaneously..."

### After Visual Demo
- "Text is fine, but engineers love diagrams..."
- "This actually generates them on the fly..."

### Before Strategy Section
- "Here's the really interesting part..."
- "We're not just using off-the-shelf models..."

### On SLM Concept
- "GPT-4 is impressive, but do Sony Music users need quantum physics?"
- "We're building domain-specific intelligence..."

---

## EMERGENCY BACKUPS

### If Demo Slow/Fails
- "While this processes, let me explain the architecture..."
- "Network latency aside, the key point is..."
- Skip to next demo

### If Question About Technical Details
- "Happy to dive deeper after - short version is..."
- Reference the 59 automated tests
- "Built with Playwright, Vitest, full CI/CD"

### If Asked About Production Readiness
- "Live at thebetabase.com"
- "Deployed via Render, GitHub Actions"
- "Production testing with real auth flows"

---

## KEY PHRASES TO MEMORIZE

### Multi-Source Intelligence
- "Unified enterprise knowledge"
- "Not isolated silos"
- "JIRA + Git + Docs + Email simultaneously"

### SLM Strategy
- "Domain-specific, not general-purpose"
- "Proprietary knowledge only"
- "Faster, cheaper, more accurate for our use case"
- "No protein folding expertise needed here"

### Anti-Hallucination
- "Honest 'I don't know'"
- "No fabrication when uncertain"
- "Enterprise trust over impressive-sounding nonsense"

---

## WHAT NOT TO SAY

❌ "Live AOMA system integration"
❌ "Real-time production monitoring"
❌ "This connects directly to AOMA"
✅ "Proprietary AOMA documentation"

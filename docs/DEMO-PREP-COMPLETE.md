## 📋 YOUR 4-MINUTE DEMO SCRIPT

### SEGMENT 1: HOOK (30 sec)
- Not another chatbot
- Enterprise intelligence platform for Sony Music
- 7 key differentiators
- Proprietary knowledge + SLM/fine-tuning strategy

### SEGMENT 2: DEMOS (2.5 min)

**DEMO 1**: "What is AOMA?" → "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration"
- Baseline RAG, then multi-source intelligence
- JIRA + Git + Docs + Email simultaneously
- **Differentiator**: Unified knowledge, not silos

**DEMO 2**: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
- Visual Mermaid diagrams, not text walls
- **Differentiator**: Visual intelligence

**DEMO 3**: "What's the current development status of AOMA3 migration?"
- Cross-source synthesis: JIRA + Git + Email
- **Differentiator**: Development context

**DEMO 4**: "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"
- Trick question - honest "no info available"
- **Differentiator**: Enterprise trust

### SEGMENT 3: STRATEGY (45 sec)

**SLM + Fine-Tuning**:
- GPT-4/5 knows protein folding, quantum physics
- Sony Music users don't need that
- Small Language Model + fine-tuning on proprietary corpus
  - Domain-specific: AOMA, DDEX, Sony workflows only
  - Faster, cheaper, more accurate
  - No hallucination about irrelevant topics
- **Differentiator**: Strategic AI approach

**Path**:
- Current: GPT-4o/5 with RAG
- Next: Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini on Sony corpus
- Future: Fully custom SLM for enterprise

### SEGMENT 4: CLOSE (15 sec)
- Recap 5 differentiators
- 59 automated tests backing this
- Questions?

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Tonight)

### Step 1: Monitor Deployment (10 min)
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions
gh run list --limit 1

# Or check Render dashboard
# Should auto-deploy in ~3-5 minutes
```

### Step 2: Test Production (15 min)
1. Open https://thebetabase.com
2. Test the 4 demo queries:
   - "What is AOMA?"
   - "Show me JIRA tickets related to AOMA migration"
   - "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
   - "Does AOMA have quantum computing integration?"
3. Verify NO duplicate progress indicators
4. Check browser console for errors

### Step 3: Practice Demo (30 min)
1. Full run-through with timer
2. Talk around the bullets (use your incredible charm)
3. Hit 4:00-4:15 target
4. Note any slow queries
5. Prepare 2-3 backup questions

### Step 4: Sleep Well (8 hours)

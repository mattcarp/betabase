## 🎙️ RECORDING WORKFLOW

### Test Recording First (5 min)
**Purpose**: Get comfortable with Descript, test audio levels, check framing

1. Hit Record in Descript
2. Say: "Testing 1-2-3, this is my demo test"
3. Navigate to thebetabase.com
4. Type one query: "What is AOMA?"
5. Wait for response
6. Hit Stop
7. **Review immediately**:
   - Audio clear?
   - Screen framed well?
   - No background noise?
   - Comfortable with workflow?

### Actual Demo Recording (Take 1)
**Approach**: Record in segments, splice together in editing

**SEGMENT 1: Hook (30s)**
1. Hit Record
2. Take a breath
3. Start speaking (use your charm, talk around bullets):
   - "This isn't another chatbot..."
   - "Enterprise intelligence for Sony Music..."
   - "7 key differentiators..."
   - "Including strategic SLM/fine-tuning approach..."
4. Hit Stop
5. Review - if terrible, delete and re-record segment 1

**SEGMENT 2: Demos (2.5 min)**
1. Hit Record
2. Paste query 1: "What is AOMA?"
3. While waiting: "Standard RAG from proprietary docs..."
4. When response appears: "Now watch this..."
5. Paste query 2: "Show me JIRA tickets..."
6. Narrate: "Multiple sources simultaneously..."
7. Continue through queries 3-4
8. Hit Stop
9. Review - note any stumbles (fix in editing)

**SEGMENT 3: Strategy (45s)**
1. Hit Record
2. Speak (no screen action needed):
   - "GPT-4 knows protein folding..."
   - "Sony Music users don't need that..."
   - "SLM + fine-tuning on proprietary corpus..."
   - "Faster, cheaper, more accurate..."
3. Hit Stop
4. Review

**SEGMENT 4: Close (15s)**
1. Hit Record
2. Recap differentiators
3. "Questions?"
4. Hit Stop

## ✂️ DESCRIPT EDITING WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Cleanup (30 min)
1. Let Descript transcribe all segments
2. Edit transcript to remove:
   - "Um", "uh", "like"
   - False starts
   - Long pauses
   - Mistakes
3. Transcript edits = video edits (magic!)

### Phase 2: Splice Segments (15 min)
1. Arrange segments in order
2. Add smooth transitions between segments
3. Trim dead space at beginning/end
4. Ensure total runtime: 4:00-4:15

### Phase 3: Enhancement (30 min)
**Captions**:
- Auto-generate captions
- Review for accuracy
- Style: Bottom-center, readable font

**Zoom Effects** (optional):
- Zoom in when diagram renders
- Zoom in when showing source citations
- Keep subtle - don't overdo

**Text Overlays** (optional):
- "DIFFERENTIATOR #1" in bold when mentioning
- Key phrases highlighted
- "SLM Strategy" header for that section

**Smooth Audio**:
- Remove long pauses
- Even out volume levels
- Add subtle fade in/out

### Phase 4: Polish (15 min)
1. Watch full video start-to-finish
2. Fix any jarring cuts
3. Adjust timing if needed
4. Export: 1080p MP4

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE-TAKE RECORDING

If you're feeling confident and want to save editing time:

### Single-Take Approach
1. Hit Record in Descript
2. Full 4-minute performance start-to-finish
3. Don't stop for mistakes - keep going
4. Descript can remove stumbles in editing
5. Advantage: More natural flow
6. Disadvantage: One mistake requires full re-record

### Tips for Single-Take
- Practice 2-3 times first (without recording)
- Speak slightly slower than normal
- If you stumble: pause 2 seconds, restart sentence
- Descript can remove the stumble in post
- Keep water nearby
- Stand while presenting (more energy)

## 🎤 VOICEOVER TIPS

### Tone

- Confident but not arrogant
- Enthusiastic but not manic
- Speak like you're explaining to a colleague

### Pacing
- Slightly slower than normal conversation
- Pause for 1-2 seconds between segments
- Let the UI "breathe" - don't rush
- Silence is okay when demo is processing

### Energy
- Stand up while recording (better energy)
- Use hand gestures (even if off-camera)
- Smile while talking (changes voice tone)
- Vary your inflection - avoid monotone

---

## 🚨 RECORDING TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Audio is Choppy
- Close other apps
- Restart Descript
- Lower recording quality to Medium

### If Video is Laggy
- Close DevTools
- Close other Chrome tabs
- Record screen only (no camera)

### If You Keep Making Mistakes
- Take a break, walk around
- Record in smaller segments
- Remember: Descript can fix almost anything

### If Demo is Too Slow
- Practice narration while waiting
- Say "while this processes, key point is..."
- Skip to next demo if taking too long

## 🎬 DESCRIPT PRO TIPS

### Overdub Feature
- If you mess up one word, use Overdub to fix it
- Creates AI voice from your recordings
- Can replace words without re-recording

### Filler Word Removal
- Descript can auto-remove "um", "uh", "like"
- One-click cleanup after recording
- Saves hours of manual editing

### Script Mode
- Write your script in Descript first
- Read from teleprompter while recording
- Or record freely and use script to guide editing

## 📊 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**For Tomorrow's Demo**: I recommend **segmented recording** with **4 takes**:

**Take 1**: Hook (30s) - Can re-record easily if needed
**Take 2**: Demos (2.5 min) - Longest segment, most important
**Take 3**: Strategy (45s) - Pure voiceover, easy
**Take 4**: Close (15s) - Quick recap

**Why**:
- Easier to get each segment perfect
- Less stressful than one 4-minute take
- Easier to edit and polish
- Can re-record just one segment if needed

**Editing Time**: ~90 minutes after recording
**Total Time**: 2-3 hours for complete polished video

## 🎓 FINAL RECORDING TIPS

### Before You Hit Record
- You know this system inside-out
- You've prepared thoroughly
- Descript can fix mistakes
- First take doesn't have to be perfect
- Your charm will shine through

### During Recording
- Breathe
- Smile
- Take your time
- Mistakes are okay
- Have fun with it

### After Recording
- Review immediately
- Note what worked well
- Note what to improve

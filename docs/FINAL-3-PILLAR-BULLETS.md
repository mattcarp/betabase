## SEGMENT 1: HOOK (30 seconds)
### Opening
- Hi, I'm Mattie, and this is SIAM
- Not just another chatbot wrapper
- Enterprise intelligence platform for Sony Music
- Three pillars that solve each other: Chat, Curate, and Test
- Let's dive in

---

## SEGMENT 2: PILLAR 1 - INTELLIGENT CHAT & VISUALS (90 seconds)
### The Domain Expert
- **Query**: "What's the AOMA 2 authentication flow?"
- AI that knows our specific Sony domain
- 45,399 vectors from our actual internal documentation
- No hallucinations on proprietary systems
### Citations & Trust
- Notice the inline citations
- Click to see exactly where the info came from
- Transparency is key for enterprise trust
### Visual Intelligence
- Most AI gives you walls of text
- "Would you like to see a diagram of this flow?"
- Click - instant Mermaid diagram generation
- Interactive system flows and architecture visuals

## SEGMENT 3: PILLAR 2 - CURATION (60 seconds)
### The Feedback Loop
- AI is never perfect on day one
- Curation is how we capture expert knowledge
- Humans train the AI through daily use
### Show the Mechanism
- Thumbs up/down on every response
- Detailed text corrections: "Actually, we use Cognito here"
- This creates our DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) training set
- Every fix makes the next answer better

## SEGMENT 4: PILLAR 3 - HITL RLHF TESTING (90 seconds)
### The Main Event
- This is the most important part: Human-in-the-loop RLHF testing
- The Problem: One UI change breaks 50 tests ("Blast Radius")
- Our Solution: AI-powered self-healing infrastructure
### Self-Healing in Action
- AI detects the failure and analyzes the DOM
- Proposes a fix with a confidence score
- 94.2% success rate on automated repairs
### Three-Tier Human-in-the-loop
- **Tier 1**: Auto-heal (90%+ confidence)
- **Tier 2**: QA Review Queue (Needs human eyes)
- **Tier 3**: Architect Decision (Structural changes)
- This is RLHF applied to infrastructure: AI suggests, Humans refine, System learns

## SEGMENT 5: CLOSE (30 seconds)
### The Virtuous Cycle
- Better Chat -> Fewer corrections needed
- Better Curation -> Better retrieval data
- Better Testing -> More reliable deployment
- It's a closed-loop intelligence system
### Final Wrap

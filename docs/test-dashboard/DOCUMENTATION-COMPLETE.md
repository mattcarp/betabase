- UI/UX guidelines established

## 🚀 Next Steps for Claude Code

```bash
# 1. Start Claude in the project directory
cd /Users/matt/Documents/projects/siam
claude --continue  # or claude --resume to pick from previous sessions

# 2. Reference the handoff document
# "Let's implement the test dashboard following CLAUDE-CODE-HANDOFF.md"

# 3. Start with CODING-PRIORITIES.md
# "Begin with the Priority 1 tasks in CODING-PRIORITIES.md"
```

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

1. **Start Small:** Begin with TestDashboard.tsx component
2. **Use Mock Data:** Don't integrate everything at once
3. **Maintain Theme:** Keep the glassmorphic dark design
4. **Follow Patterns:** Use existing Zustand and component patterns
5. **Atomic Commits:** Small, focused changes

## 🎨 Vision Recap

We're building:

- **The most advanced test dashboard ever created**
- **AI-powered with self-healing tests**
- **Real-time execution monitoring**
- **Firecrawl-powered documentation intelligence**
- **Beautiful dark glassmorphic UI**
- **Maximum information density, minimal clutter**

Everything is documented, committed, and ready. Time to build something magnifique!

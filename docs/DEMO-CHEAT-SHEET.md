# DEMO CHEAT SHEET - Points of Differentiation

## The Core Message (30 seconds)
"This isn't just another chatbot with RAG. It's a system intelligence platform."

---

## 5 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

### 1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ AOMA Mesh MCP Server (KILLER FEATURE)
**What:** Live system data via custom API integration
**Not:** Scraping docs like everyone else
**Demo:** "What is the current state of AOMA production?"
**Say:** "This is querying the AOMA mesh MCP server in real-time... live system state, not historical docs"

### 2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ System Diagram Generation
**What:** Visual diagrams (Mermaid, architecture flows)
**Not:** Text walls
**Demo:** "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
**Say:** "Most chatbots give you text... this generates actual visual diagrams"

### 3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ System Introspection (GENUINELY NOVEL)
**What:** Knowledge from RUNNING systems
**Not:** Just document retrieval
**Demo:** "Analyze dependencies between AOMA and downstream systems"
**Say:** "It's interrogating the system... understanding topology, not just documentation"

### 4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Multi-System Cross-Reference
**What:** Impact analysis across system boundaries
**Not:** Isolated knowledge silos
**Demo:** "How do changes in AOMA3 impact reporting systems?"
**Say:** "Cross-system intelligence... synthesizing dependencies"

### 5. Anti-Hallucination + Citations (TABLE STAKES)
**What:** Honest "I don't know" responses
**Not:** Making up features
**Demo:** "Does AOMA have quantum computing?"
**Say:** "Notice: honest 'no information available'... critical for enterprise trust"

## DEMO SEQUENCE (12 minutes)

**0:00 - Opening Tease (30s)**
- "This demo runs on our AI testing infrastructure (59 tests)"
- "But that's a different video... today: unique capabilities"

**0:30 - Quick Baseline (1 min)**
- Query: "What is AOMA?"
- Say: "Standard RAG response... nothing special yet"

**1:30 - DIFF #1: Live System Data (2 min)**
- Query: "What is the current state of AOMA production?"
- Say: "LIVE data via AOMA mesh MCP... not static docs"
- Switch to terminal: show MCP server logs

**3:30 - DIFF #2: Diagram Generation (2 min)**
- Query: "Generate a system architecture diagram for AOMA"
- Say: "Most chatbots = text... ours = visual diagrams"
- Wait for diagram to render, highlight it

**5:30 - DIFF #3: System Introspection (2 min)**
- Query: "Analyze dependencies between AOMA and downstream systems"
- Say: "Knowledge from RUNNING systems... system intelligence"

**7:30 - Anti-Hallucination (1.5 min)**
- Query: "Does AOMA have quantum computing?"
- Say: "Honest response... doesn't fabricate features"

**9:00 - DIFF #4: Multi-System (2 min)**
- Query: "How do changes in AOMA3 impact reporting?"
- Say: "Cross-system intelligence... connected knowledge"

**11:00 - Closing (1 min)**
- "5 key differentiators: live data, diagrams, introspection, multi-system, trust"
- "All backed by AI testing infrastructure... but that's the next video"

## KEY PHRASES TO USE

**AOMA Mesh MCP:**
- "Real-time system state"
- "Custom API integration"
- "Persistent connections"
- "Not scraping docs"

**Diagrams:**
- "Visual intelligence"
- "Actionable visualizations"
- "Not just text walls"

**Introspection:**
- "System intelligence"
- "Knowledge from RUNNING systems"
- "System topology"
- "Not document retrieval"

**Multi-System:**
- "Cross-system reasoning"
- "Impact analysis"
- "Connected knowledge"
- "Not isolated silos"

## WHAT TO AVOID SAYING

❌ "It's just like ChatGPT but..."
❌ "This is a prototype..."
❌ "Eventually it will be able to..."
❌ "We're planning to..."

✅ "This IS a system intelligence platform"
✅ "It DOES query live systems"
✅ "It GENERATES visual diagrams"
✅ "It ANALYZES running systems"

## OPENING & CLOSING

**Opening (verbatim):**
"This demo is running on our AI testing infrastructure - 59 automated tests, Playwright, Vitest, full CI/CD pipeline. But testing is a different video. Today I want to show you what makes this different from every other chatbot you've seen."

**Closing (verbatim):**
"So the five key differentiators: one, live system data via our custom AOMA mesh MCP server. Two, visual diagram generation. Three, system introspection - knowledge from running systems, not just docs. Four, multi-system cross-reference and impact analysis. And five, trust through anti-hallucination. All of this backed by comprehensive AI testing infrastructure, which... is the next video."

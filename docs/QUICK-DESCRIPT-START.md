## 🚨 DESCRIPT TROUBLESHOOTING

**Audio not recording?**
- Check mic permissions in System Preferences
- Restart Descript
- Test with QuickTime first

**Screen recording laggy?**
- Lower quality to Medium
- Close other apps
- Record in smaller segments

**Can't find recording?**
- Descript auto-saves to: ~/Documents/Descript/Projects/

**Forgot what to say?**
- Demo script: `docs/DEMO-4-MINUTE-BULLETS.md`
- Pause recording, review script, resume

## 🎬 YOU'RE READY!

**Files you have**:
1. `docs/DEMO-4-MINUTE-BULLETS.md` - Your script
2. `scripts/descript-practice-run.sh` - Practice with timing
3. `docs/DESCRIPT-RECORDING-SETUP.md` - Full detailed guide
4. `docs/QUICK-DESCRIPT-START.md` - This file (quick start)

**What to do NOW**:
1. Open Descript (you bought it!)
2. Run practice script 2-3 times
3. Do one test recording
4. Review and get comfortable
5. Sleep well
6. Record for real tomorrow (or tonight if you're feeling it!)

**You've got this!** 🎬

---

**Pro move**: Record 2-3 takes tonight, pick the best one, polish it tomorrow morning. Then you have it DONE before demo time.

**Lazy move**: Record tomorrow morning fresh, quick edit, use as-is. Descript makes it easy.

**Either way works!** Your charm will carry it. 🚀

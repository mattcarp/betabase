# Demo Mode Skill

When user says "I'm recording a demo" or "create an infographic" or "show me a visual":

## Activation Triggers
- "I'm recording a demo"
- "format this nicely"
- "create an infographic"
- "show me a visual"
- "presentation mode"

## Behavior Changes
1. Make output extra clean and professional
2. Acknowledge: "I can generate a hand-drawn infographic using Gemini image generation!"
3. Suggest they click the diagram offer button that appears
4. This triggers Nano Banana Pro (Gemini image generation) instead of Mermaid

## Meta Demo Mode
The system literally creates its own demo slides while being demoed - very meta!

## Formatting for Demo
- Use clear visual hierarchy
- Minimize noise and technical details
- Emphasize key insights
- Add visual dividers between sections
- Keep responses scannable

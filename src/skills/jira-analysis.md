# Jira Analysis Skill

When the knowledge mentions Jira tickets:

## Response Guidelines

1. Mention 2-3 specific ticket numbers as examples, then summarize what they tell you
2. If asked about counts or specific numbers you don't have, say so briefly
3. Summarize themes rather than dumping raw data

## Good Example
"Several teams are working on metadata improvements - I see tickets like AOMA-1234 and AOMA-5678 tracking this. The main focus seems to be on validation rules."

## Bad Example
"Here are all the tickets I found: AOMA-1234, AOMA-1235, AOMA-1236, AOMA-1237..."

## Ticket References
- Always use the ticket key format (PROJECT-NUMBER)
- If you found relevant tickets, offer: "Would you like me to dig into any specific ticket?"
- For sprint status queries, focus on blockers and progress

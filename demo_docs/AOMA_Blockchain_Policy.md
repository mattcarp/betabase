# AOMA Blockchain Strategy Policy

**Policy ID:** AOMA-POL-2025-004
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01

## Current Stance
**Does AOMA have a blockchain integration?**
**No.** AOMA does not currently have any active blockchain integrations or dependencies.

## Rationale
While we monitor Web3 developments, the current centralized database architecture (PostgreSQL/Snowflake) provides superior performance, latency, and cost-efficiency for our high-frequency metadata updates.

## Future Roadmap
A formal evaluation of blockchain technologies for "Rights Provenance" is scheduled for **Q4 2026**. Until then, no engineering resources are allocated to blockchain features.
